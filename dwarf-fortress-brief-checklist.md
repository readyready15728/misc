# Dwarf Fortress Brief Checklist

## What to do when establishing a new fort

* Just turn werebeasts off, period.
* Chop down a few trees and use the cleared area for a pasture.
* Start setting work details, including assigning all available picks.
* Make an entrance that can permit an "airlocked" trade depot using two
drawbridges, a serpentine hall of traps, an initial stockpile for everything
and a 5x5 shaft for 1x3 stairs.
* Carve 1x3 passages out of the west and east sides of the shaft and start
building 9x9 rooms in a grid with a N-S corridor in between.
* An agricultural floor should come first with farming on it if possible. If
not, establish farming on the entrance floor but put stockpiles and
agricultural workshops on a lower level.
* Put a temporary meeting area on the agricultural floor and maybe move it
later.
* Build an industrial floor and make a 1x1 garbage zone therein. Make
wheelbarrows for any stone stockpiles.
* Gradually move things out of the initial stockpile. (This can be done by
moving items from one stockpile to another without disabling those goods in
the initial stockpile.)
* Hotkey locations for "Trade depot", "Agricultural floor" and "Industrial
floor" should now be established and so on later.
* Try to build a well in the agricultural floor which should be easy with an
aquifer present.
