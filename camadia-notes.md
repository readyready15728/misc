# Camadia Notes

- The guild warehouse is in the west of the starter island.
- Woodcutting drops seeds.
- When cutting wood, you will find some seeds randomly and sometimes when
  fighting and killing insects. There are also some in the guild warehouse. For
  low levels, you can plant radish seeds.
- The seeds turn into fruit and must be harvested after a day to prevent them
  from spoiling. They, along with cooked fish and cooked meat, are used during
  combat rounds to increase health.
- "\[Before combat, first\], build a warehouse and put extra supplies and
  equipment in it. Only take food and equipped items like daggers."
- I have built a farm (Farming) and storehouse in Cormack in Newfoundland and
  there it is also possible to do Woodcutting and use the Sawmill (Carpentry).
- Rats are the lowest level enemies one can fight (Combat), in Roddickton in
  Newfoundland.
- Combat skills need to be switched manually to train them.
- In Springdale in Newfoundland one can do Cooking.
- One can do Mining in Gander in Newfoundland. There is also a Trading Post in
  Gander.
- Text in the guild channel is private to members of the guild.
