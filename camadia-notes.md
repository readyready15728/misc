# Camadia Notes

- The guild warehouse is in the west of the starter island.
- Woodcutting drops seeds.
- When cutting wood, you will find some seeds randomly and sometimes when
  fighting and killing insects. There are also some in the guild warehouse. For
  low levels, you can plant radish seeds.
- The seeds turn into fruit and must be harvested after a day to prevent them
  from spoiling. They, along with cooked fish and cooked meat, are used during
  combat rounds to increase health.
