# Might and Magic Notes
## Notes on the Might and Magic RPG series

### Might and Magic 4-5
* **JUST PLAY THE FLOPPY VERSION**.
* Transfer items from default party to new characters before heading out.
* Click on a stat during character creation to swap it with another one.
* The part I came up with was Half-Orc Knight (Ugluk), Human Paladin
(Grimaldus), Dwarf Robber (Miriam), Human Archer (Wilhelm), Gnome Cleric
(Adelheid) and Elf Sorcerer (Lalaith).
* Party order appears not to matter too much except for bashing doors so at
least fill the first two slots with strong characters.
* Items can break (how does one know when?) and can be repaired.
* Item stats can be found in the cluebook.
* I'm not sure that ranged weapons can be used in melee.
* One can have both a melee and missile weapon equipped.
* Other characters besides Archer et al. can use ranged weapons.
* If your party has Cartographer then you can click on the Might and Magic
logo in the upper right to show the map.
* Money does in fact grow on trees in Vertigo at least.
* Sleeping too much will age characters rapidly. (It's actually not really
**THAT** bad.)
* Higher AC is better.
* Not every member of the party needs to know a given skill. For example, one
with Cartographer will satisfy the needs of the entire party and only two
with Pathfinder are necessary.
* Search everything.
* Training is done in town.
* "M" is a very useful shortcut for showing the large map.
* During combat, monsters can be targeted in combat with the numerical keys 1,
2 and 3.
* It's possible to trade items during combat.
* Spells with limited duration can benefit from maximum duration by being cast
right after dawn.
* The bank generates interest.
* The fountain in Vertigo restores health once the secret of Joe's storeroom
is unveiled.
* Copy protection words are in the reference card.
* The skeleton in the Dwarf Mines that confers Danger Sense can be used on
everyone. Same goes for the Direction Sense skeleton.
* Broken weapons need to be reequipped after being repaired.
* Mountaineer and the Guild are swapped in the cluebook map of Rivercity.
* The cluebook doesn't seem to mention the chest puzzle in the southwest of
Castleview.
* Minotaurs can age their victims.
* The cluebook has levels two and three of the Dungeon of Lost Souls swapped.
* On the fourth floor of the Dungeon of Lost Souls, pull the third
northernmost lever in the west, head over to pull the third northernmost lever
in the east and then the stairs down will be in the southeastern corner.
* Protection from Elements can be cast in addition to Day of Protection.
