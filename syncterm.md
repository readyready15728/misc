# SyncTERM

[SyncTERM](http://syncterm.bbsdev.net/) is a BBS client that runs on Linux. The
author is somewhat cryptic about installing from source but it's really as
simple as unpacking the source archive, then, from the root of the unpacked
archive:

1. `cd src/syncterm`
2. `make`
3. `sudo make install`
