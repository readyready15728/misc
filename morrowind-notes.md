# Morrowind Notes

- Turn on subtitles.
- `WASD` for movement, mouse to look around.
- `<Space>` activates people and objects you are looking at.
- [Male and female characters of each race do in fact have slightly different
distributions of attributes](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Races).
- There are also a [few other effects of gender
  in-game](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Gender).
- For a beginner character, I will be doing a male Orc Crusader born under the
  sign of Lady.
- Right-clicking opens menus. After you're done using them, use right-click
  again to dismiss them.
- My papers had "take" and "close" at the top.
- You can click and move objects from the game world to your inventory.
- I accidentally discovered `<Tab>` changes the camera from first- to
  third-person.
- When I received my first weapon (a dagger), I equipped it by going into
  inventory and dropping it on my character.
- Press `F` to draw or sheath your weapon.
- Click and hold the left mouse button to attack. Holding it down longer will
  result in more powerful (but more Fatigue-inducing) attacks.
- Legible items in the world can be read with `<Space>`. Legible items in
  inventory can be "equipped" to be read.
- Torches and lights can also be equipped and have a finite duration.
- Lock picks have to be readied after being equipped to be used. Use the left
  mouse button to make an attempt.
- Select an active spell in the magic menu, then `R` to ready, and left mouse
  button to cast.
- Using Persuasion can backfire if not successful.
- `J` to open journal.
- Using `<Space>` on objects typically seems to take them.
- `E` jumps.
- `T` shows the time and enables waiting and resting.
- Running induces Fatigue.
- Look for "Training" in dialogues at the appropriate places.
