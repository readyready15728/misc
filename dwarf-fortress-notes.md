# Dwarf Fortress Notes

## Strike the earth

* A beginner should set "Number of Beasts" to "Low" and "Natural Savagery" to
"Very Low".
* (Light) aquifers are nearly impossible to avoid so it is best to figure out
how to deal with them.
* Other than that, one should look for:
  * "Woodland" or "Heavily Forested" (or, at the very least, "Sparsely
  Forested")
  * "Serene" or "Calm" surroundings or at least not an evil or savage biome
  * A river
  In addition, these features help:
  * "Warm" or "Temperate" climate
  * "Clay", "Sand" or "Soil" for farming and pottery and glass production
  * Flux stone layer for steel industry (trading can ameliorate the lack
  thereof)
  * No bad neighbors nearby
  * On the same continent as an active Dwarven civilization
* Initially, set "Hunters" and "Fisherdwarves" to "Nobody does this" to avoid
lone Dwarves getting picked off by wildlife.
* The initial complement of tools includes three pickaxes so three Dwarves
should be assigned to mining duty. It may make sense to assign mining duty to
Dwarves who aren't initially very useful.
* The quickstart guide advises that custom labor details will need to be
created for certain types of labor such as "Wood Burning" and "Blacksmithing"
but doesn't give much detail on how these custom labor details should be
organized.
* Delving a 3x3 pit at the beginning, then digging out from there (at least 10
squares if not 20) will allow wagons to enter the uppermost reaches of the
fortress complex.
* There should be **ONLY** one entrance.
* When mining, press one of the direction keys to designate 10 squares in any
direction to be added to the current order.
* Forging more picks is necessary to make for more miners.
* Mining, woodcutting and hunting labors are mutually exclusive.
* The initial entry passage needs to be widened to three tiles about halfway
along its length, to admit trade wagons. From there, a three-tile-wide passage
way will need to be opened into a 5x5 trade depot off to one side. From there,
keep the entrance one tile wide for two tiles leading into a 5x5 main
stairwell area. From the main stairwell area dig a one-tile-wide hallway far
enough to dig a centered entrance to an 11x11 initial general stockpile area
(accepting everything but corpses, refuse, wood, stone and gems). It should
all look something like this: ![Entrance halls](df-entrance-halls.png)
* In general, players seem to like hallways that are three tiles wide.
Three-wide staircases should also be adequate for all but the most extravagant
fortresses.
