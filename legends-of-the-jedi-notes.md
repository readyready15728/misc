* Welcome to Legends of the Jedi! We are a roleplay-enforced MUD based in the
Star Wars Expanded Universe. If this is your first time playing on LotJ, You
can speak directly to the staff on a private channel, IMMCHAT, or you can
speak with the player elected RPC (Role Play Council) on the channel 'RPC',
and let us know you're here! The command is: <channel name> <your message>.
(For example, 'Immchat Hello').
* 'prompt default3'.
* 'score', 'levels', 'practice', 'equipment', 'inventory', 'slist'.
* 'hail'.
* 'examine 2.container'.
* 'approach <target>'.
* One should only quit in rooms labeled [Hotel]. (Use 'hail hotel'.)
* To set the LotJ MUD client right panel width, go into Toolbox → Script
Editor → Scripts → lotj-ui → layout and then edit line 4 where it refers to
`rightPanelWidthPct`. It will then be necessary to save and start the client
again.
* "The skills and abilities available to you will depend on your LEVEL in any
particular class. The slist all command will show you the complete skill list
and the required level. Maximum levels are determined by your main class, race,
and trained stats. The showrace command shows the relationship between race and
max levels. Maximum levels are revealed when you hit 3 in that class. The
mainchange command will let you swap your main class until you hit level 30.".
* "The PRACTICE command will list all the skills you currently have, and how
adept you are in them. The quickest way to learn new skills is by using the
RESEARCH skill in a room flagged as a LIBRARY - just like this one."
* "An Aspiring Bounty Hunter says to you 'You can **research** a ton of skills
in libraries, but not all of them. You'll need to learn the art of smuggling
and bounty hunting from someone who knows what they're doing, and spend a ton
of time **study**ing if you want to learn about science. Now I need to go find
me a hunting teacher...'.".
* "Type 'autoresearch start' to start researching all skills below 90%."
* "Correct smuggling skills are taught by other players or by one or two NpCs
in game".
* "This limits the max percentage of your ability with that skill before you
use it and maximize it yourself manually. For example you can usually
research something like make container to 90%. But smuggling skills on the
whole average 20% when taught by an NPC. This is a stark difference and means
that you'll have to spend a lot more time using the skill to master it. There
are certain characters in game that might be able to teach you as players. A
player teaching you will teach you up to half of their leadership level in the
skill. If they have specialized in leadership as their main class and
smuggling as their subclass, they instead will likely teach up to 97%".
* 'say', 'sayto'.

* 'clantalk'.
* 'currentcom'.
* 'setencryption'.
* 'tune'.
* 'help chat'.
* 'immchat'.

* Description and history files are required by level 30.
* 'help biotemplate'.
* "A good character description will explore your character's physical
appearance without imposing feelings or emotions on the players looking at
you. Character descriptions must be at least one paragraph long."
* "A good history file will provide a few basic facts about your character as
  well as a short biography or origin story. History files are a great
opportunity to explore your character's roots and figure out how you want to
RP. Many players use a premade template (see help biotemplate for examples),
but you can customize your history as you please."
* 'greet <target player> [as <alias>]'.
* 'greet all'.
* 'dub'.
* 'inform'.
* "The memorycheck command can be used to recall your character's greets and
dubs, add notes, and rename as necessary. Greets and dubs fade over time if
you don't see that character for a while."
* 'help memorycheck'.
* "You are not restricted to the prompt you chose at character creation! LOTJ
features an extensive prompt customization system with many different tokens
for both normal prompts (prompt command) and combat prompts (fprompt command).
Read Help Prompt_Tokens to see all of your options.".
* "Once you are happy with your prompts, you can then save them to your account
using account prompt/fprompt to quickly retrieve on other characters.".
* 'help force_system' / 'flist'.
* "When your characters die, there's a chance you will accumulate account
points if they meet certain requirements. Points can be used in chargen to
purchase more advanced races or starting levels for new characters. Besides
character death, you can also earn points by participating in roleplay scenes
and events.".
* Logging is essentially necessary. (Log in plain text to save space.)
