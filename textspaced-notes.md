# TextSpaced Notes

- "Fuel is used to travel at sublight and used to recharge your FTL engine,
  fuel is measured in LYs as well so a straight one to one mapping, easy right!"
- "FTL travel is instant travel as far as your ship can take you, listed as
  maximum FTL range. But... FTL travel can only be used to travel from a system
  to a discovered system."
- "FTL travel is instant travel as far as your ship can take you, listed as
  maximum FTL range. But... FTL travel can only be used to travel from a system
  to a discovered system."
- "To discover a new system you can visit the same sublight section in the
  helm window and choose to explore in either direction. When you do this, your
  ship will travel until an undiscovered system is found which your ship will
  stop at."
- "But, you can also sometimes see undiscovered systems thanks to your
  sensors. Systems can be seen from different ranges depending on the brightness
  or size of its star. You can check for nearby undiscovered systems by opening
  the helm window, selecting nearby and then scrolling to the undiscovered
  section."
- "Discovering systems is quite important, as it provides more sites for
  building, charting, gathering, hunting and mining."
- "Your ship has a maximum fuel capacity, this is measured in light years, or
  LYs. When you travel at sublight speed which takes time, you will consume fuel
  at the exact rate of the distance you travel."
- "If you use instant FTL travel you will consume light drive charge, this
  charge is refilling automatically by converting fuel. How fast a ship can
  convert 0.1 light years of fuel to charge changes from ship to ship and is
  stated as a charge rate. This charge rate is measured in minutes... so a
  charge rate of 5 minutes means every 5 minutes your FTL charge increase by 0.1
  light years."
- "As you might expect you cannot use FTL travel if you don't have enough
  charge. If you run out of fuel, no charge will be generated. You can still
  travel at sublight, but your speed will be dire, capped at 0.1 light years per
  minute."
- "You'll notice that when you arrive at a system you'll always be in orbit of
  the systems star. A system is a collection of bodies like planets, wormholes,
  just things that are orbiting the star. Bodies will have commodities you can
  mine and structures can be built in orbit of bodies, on the surface of the
  body - or both really. If a system is unclaimed building a structure anywhere
  in the system regardless of what is built, will claim the system after 24
  hours."
- "You can view the details of a system by opening the helm window and
  selecting system. You'll be able to see the bodies, ships present and any
  rules set. Rules can be set by whichever faction owns the system, but I
  wouldn't worry about that for now, in this simulation AG Systems owns all the
  systems and the region. A region is just 50 LYs of space, the region owner is
  the faction that owns the most systems in a region."
- "Charting is important as once a planet is charted you'll be able to see the
  abundant wildlife present and the abundant consumables. These are wildlife and
  consumables which can be hunted or gathered respectively without damaging the
  planets ecology (or geology when we were taking about mining)."
- "Let's chart the resonant planet in this system as your next test. Open the
  system section of the helm window, find the resonant planet and then use the
  contextual menu next to it to chart."
- "Wormholes are naturally unstable, but with the right ship can be made
  stable and directed to exit normal space at a given point. Factions use
  wormholes to connect their systems to travel vast distances. They can even be
  monetised by building a Toll Bridge structure to charge everyone that travels
  through. Just like FTL travel they provide almost instant travel to their
  other side."
- "The planet you just charted contains an abundance of Plasma Stones, which
  are an ad-hoc type of fuel. You can check this by opening the same system
  section again and clicking the body name. Fuel consumables are of course
  useful as we can use them to add fuel back into our ship, so let's gather
  some."
- "The process is the same, open the system section but this time use the
  contextual option to gather. Let's collect at least ten for your journey
  ahead—don't worry I'll speed it up again for you. Just hit the stop button
  once you have collected 10, stated as x10."
- "The search section is so damn useful. From here you can search for systems
  by name, owner or position. You can find systems with certain bodies and
  nearby unclaimed or uncharted systems."
- "If you were observant you might of noticed we gathered more than just
  Plasma Stones, but also picked up a valuable relic. We can sell this at
  systems that have the trading consumables service, wait sorry, let's talk
  about services quickly first."
- "So when you build a structure in a system, let's say a Merchant Station,
  this structure will provide a service to anyone visiting the system. In the
  case of a Merchant Station it provides the Trading Commodities and Trading
  Ports services. When other captains use those services, like buying shit, the
  owners of those structures get a profit."
- "We are looking for somewhere that has the Trading Consumables service,
  since the relic we have is classed as a consumable. Open up the search section
  in helm, scroll to the services section and change the drop down filter to
  Trading Consumables. You should see it come up with a system named 'Indus'
  (I've added it to your faction discoveries), but sometimes it does not, so you
  can also fly there manually by punching in position 2000028.4. Once you are
  there let me know and we'll start the cargo portion of your training."
- "OK. Cargo. So cargo can be in your hold, can be adrift in space or inside
  of structures. Cargo is anything you can pickup, from commodities and
  consumables to equipment and passengers. If we want to sell that relic, we
  need to find it first. So let's open the cargo window and choose the hold
  section."
- "The hold section is a complete itinerary of everything you are carrying by
  category. Since the relic is a consumable, you'll see it in the consumables
  group. Find it, use the contextual menu and sell it. Selling the relic will
  give us some credits we can use to buy a better ship finally (the Shuttle is
  like the shittest shitbox you can fly). Once you've sold it, buzz me again to
  walk you through buying a ship."
- "You'll get to keep the ship when the simulation ends as a little reward,
  plus we will credit your account with 100,000 credits as some walking around
  money. So any credits you earn in this simulation won't be real."
- "Alright, remember how I talked about services before and how structures
  provide them. Well in this system there is a Shipwright meaning this system
  has the useful service of Ship Trading. We can see the services available by
  opening the services window; the headings at the top list all the services you
  can interact with."
- "The Barge has a skill requirement of level 1 mining craft, you can see the
  details of the ship by clicking its name. I've activated your skills tracker
  now so you have all the craft skills at level 1, so, buy the ship and we'll
  talk next about fitting mining beams. But in the future you'll need to realise
  your own skills. I'm not always going to be here."
- "Once you have purchased the ship, open the command window, select ownership
  and scroll to the parked ships section. Use the contextual menu for the Barge
  to command it - then you'll be flying a Barge instead of a Shuttle."
- "The Barge is a mining role ship, the roles of ships are important. A mining
  role ship will double all mining yields and the Barge in particular has a perk
  that makes finding exotic cargo more likely, such as pure versions of
  commodities. But, we should improve how quickly this thing can mine
  commodities (you know like iron, hydrogen, dark matter whatever). You can do
  this in lots of ways like realising mining skills, hiring mining crew even
  using Tugs, but the easiest way is by buying and fitting mining beams."
- "This system sells basic level one mining beams, so let's buy some. Open the
  services window, select Trading Ports and then find the equipment group. The
  mining beam we are looking for is called "Moraine Mining Beam" and is likely
  on the second page of equipment. Find it and press the buy button, then when
  the confirmation appears change it from "store in hold" to "fit to ship", then
  fit as many as you can and confirm the purchase. Once you have fitted some
  mining beams, contact me again."
- "The system we are in allows mining, but you can double check by opening the
  helm window and clicking the system section. You'll see there is a system
  rules section listing all the things allowed in the system by the faction, one
  of which is mining. If you perform an action that is against the rules your
  faction will lose karma with the faction that owns the system. Both factions
  can see the deduction of karma in their logs and the reason and decide what to
  do from there, this includes declaring war on your faction... but that is rare
  and we'll cover that later. For now, let's get to mining - an easy way to make
  some credits."
- "To mine a body for commodities you can click into the body name in helm and
  do it that way, but there is a quick way I like to do it. Open the engineering
  window and press mining and there is a group called system commodities. This
  handy interface lists every commodity you can mine from every body in the
  system. In this simulation the nebula just has hydrogen present, so press the
  mine button next to system commodities and you'll start mining. Once you have
  finished mining I'll walk you though selling you haul, again, I'll speed up
  the process for you."
- "Commodities can be traded, so you can sell what you mine for profit.
  Another use for commodities is to refine them into pure forms, these pure
  forms which are classes as consumables can then be used to fabricate structure
  components - you know the parts used to build structures."
- "Lastly (at least what comes to mind) is terraforming. You can put
  commodities back into a planet in an attempt to terraform it to make it a
  nicer world. My uncle once terraformed a barren planet into a lush tropical
  planet; said it took him almost a year. Been tempted to try and create an ice
  planet for Tilly..."
- "Alright, you've mined a nice load of hydrogen now it's time to sell it.
  Selling a commodity in the same system it is mined is a bad idea as you'll get
  a lower price. Instead, we need to find another system which has the Trading
  Commodities service to sell this hydrogen at. Our current location is the
  Indus system as position 2,000,028.40, so let's explore in the positive
  direction until we come across a new system with the Trading Commodities
  service (hint, we definitely will in 0.2 LYs it's called Axum)."
- "The price a commodity sells for is based on three things: system
  availability, region availability and galactic availability. The more common
  or the more of a commodity that exists as extracted, the lower the price will
  be. So you will see the price change from region to region, with some systems
  having a slightly different price. There are also market shifts that can
  change the price, this is based on the galactic availability. Lastly, your own
  charisma and skills can affect the price. If you are charming you'll have a
  better trading modifier which means better deals, if you are a bit of a
  bastard - worst deals."
- "Back, sorry. You are in the Axum system, perfect-o (ancients praise I sound
  like my Pops). This system has the Trading Commodities service as well, so
  let's sell the hydrogen we mined."
- "Open the cargo window, select the hold section and find the group for
  commodities. Using the contextual menu for hydrogen select the sell option. A
  confirmation slider will appear, move the slider or type the maximum quantity
  to sell all of the hydrogen and you'll get credits in return."
- "Something we haven't covered yet is adrift cargo. Adrift cargo is just
  cargo floating around in space, this could be because someone ejected it or
  someone's ship or structure went kablam. So, to recover adrift cargo open the
  cargo window, select adrift cargo and anything adrift will be listed."
- "So recovering cargo is pretty easy after all, huh. Once cargo is recovered
  you can do whatever you want with it, keep it, sell it, store it, whatever. Be
  careful though, some factions might set the salvage rule to disallow, meaning
  you'll take a karma hit if you salvage in those systems - up to you if you
  care about that."
- "It's always good to refuel when you can, since it's cheap. The Axum system
  has the Ship Refuel service since there is a Fuel Station structure present.
  To refuel, open the services window and select Ship Refuel. Press the button
  for ship refuel and then whack the slider to full to completely refuel your
  ship. Buzz me when you're ready."
- "If you run out of fuel your light drive will not gain charge and you will
  limp along at a sublight speed of 0.01 LYs a minute, which is basically like
  walking. Remember there are fuel consumables you can keep around just in case
  as well, like fuel cells."
- "Communication and information is important, so it's worth me briefly
  speaking about this. First, you can find a log of every action you've done by
  opening the computer window, selecting logs and looking at the personal log
  group. You can also access this same information by selecting the tab group in
  the chat at the bottom right - or - if you are using your mobile command
  device, select chat under the account menu. But, what I'd actually like you to
  do is introduce yourself to the galaxy. To do this, type a message into the
  chat window at the bottom right, or select it from the account section if
  mobile. It will default to the chat channel, so just type a greeting message.
  Once you've done that call me back."
- "Missions, ah, missions. If you want to gain skill points to realise new
  skills you'll need to complete missions. I won't have you complete any during
  this sim but here's how it works. In the missions window, select missions to
  browse all the ones available. The missions will be matched to your skill
  level and a little bit above, the steps and rewards are listed before you
  accept. Once you accept a mission you complete the steps to get the rewards.
  The nice thing about missions is that once you accept one, when you view the
  details of the mission, at the bottom it has a megagram of FAQs explaining how
  to do each step - so you shouldn't get stuck."
- "Feel free to check out the missions and experiment with the filters to get
  familiar. Once you are ready to move on we'll need to talk about combat, but
  before that we've missed something super important! We haven't given your ship
  a name. To do this, open the tactical window by clicking on your ship name and
  select the ship section. There is a pencil icon to rename your ship inline
  with your current ship name (under the picture), click this pencil and give
  your ship a name you'll remember (it will be important in a bit). Once you
  have set a new name, I'll call you back."
- "So in combat we had a load of random cards right? This happens when you
  don't define a combat deck or cannot fill it. A combat deck is ship specific
  and we can make one up in the tactical window. To do this, press the cards
  section in the tactical window and in the section called current deck, press
  the deck builder link. You can add any cards you want to your deck by pressing
  the plus button, up to 25. You can also only add up to 5 special cards.
  Building a deck although not essential, will make combat easier for you in the
  future. So have a play around with it and call me back when you are ready."
- Re: getting new cards: "I've loaded a basic set into your computer. But,
  each ship will give you some new cards that are ship specific. Other than that
  you will need to learn skills to obtain new cards. Oh - some fancy equipment
  also sometimes interfaces with your computer to show new cards as well"
