# Python GIS Learning Resources
## Resources for doing GIS tasks in Python that don't involve ArcGIS or (typically) even QGIS because I'm cheap and want to do things purely programmatically

* [Geo-Python 2024](https://geo-python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (mainly focuses on getting up and running with Python and other associated tools such as Jupyter and Git rather than GIS but looked pretty decent)
* [Automating GIS Processes 2024](https://autogis-site.readthedocs.io) (successor to Geo-Python also from the University of Helsinki; going through it now and learning a decent amount but there are a few flaws here and there)
* [Introduction to Python for Geographic Data Analysis](https://pythongis.org) (also from the University of Helsinki people; presented in more of a book format than lecture with notes format; WIP but at least gives an idea about where to find other material by using the text for keywords in search queries)
* [Spatial Data Science for Sustainable Development](https://sustainability-gis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (similar to "Automating GIS Processes" with an obvious focus; includes agent-based simulation!)
* [A course on Geographic Data Science](https://darribas.org/gds_course/content/home.html) (geographic *data science* with Python in a course format with lecture videos)
* [Geographic Data Science with Python](https://geographicdata.science/book/intro.html) (similar to the above but in book format)
* [Earth Lab: Free online courses, tutorials and tools](https://www.earthdatascience.org/) (various learning materials using Python as well as QGIS and R; layout seems a bit confusing)
* [Geocomputation with Python](https://py.geocompx.org/) (book with an [R counterpart](https://r.geocompx.org/))
* [PyQGIS 101: Introduction to QGIS Python programming for non-programmers](https://anitagraser.com/pyqgis-101-introduction-to-qgis-python-programming-for-non-programmers/) (apparently PyQGIS tutorials are better than the official documentation)
* [Kaggle Learn's Geospatial Analysis tutorials](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/geospatial-analysis) (comes with automatically graded Jupyter notebooks)
* [GIS Programming Roadmap](https://github.com/petedannemann/gis-programming-roadmap/blob/master/README.md) (a Markdown resource a bit similar too my own here)
* [Leafmap Tutorials](https://leafmap.org/tutorials/) (the Leafmap website's "official" tutorials)
* [Introduction to GIS Programming](https://geog-312.gishub.org/) (from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville; similar to "Geo-Python" but possibly a bit more in depth)
* [michaelminn.net's GIS Tutorials](https://michaelminn.net/tutorials/) (varied but includes tutorials for Python specifically)
* [Spatial Thoughts' Python courses](https://spatialthoughts.com/courses/) (a trio of a basic Python GIS course, mapping / visualization course and a third concerning PyQGIS)
* [Introduction to Python Scripting for Geospatial](https://pratt-savi-810.github.io/) (not so much a course as a bunch of completed Jupyter notebooks but still could be useful)
* [A course on Spatial Data Science](https://martinfleischmann.net/sds/) (course loosely based on aforementioned "Geographic Data Science with Python")
* [PyGIS - Open Source Spatial Programming & Remote Sensing](https://pygis.io/docs/a_intro.html) (another machine learning course with perhaps more of a heavy focus on raster operations)
* [Spatial Data Programming with Python (2024)](https://geobgu.xyz/py/) (author Michael Dorman's website where the course has a large number of other resources)
* [Python for GIS and Geoscience](https://jorisvandenbossche.github.io/DS-python-geospatial/) (course in the form of really detailed notebooks with solutions from the University of Ghent but at least one of the notebooks requires ~12 GB available RAM; run in Kaggle?)
* [Introduction to GIS in Python](https://onsgeo.github.io/geospatial-training/docs/intro_to_gis_in_python) (hosted by the UK's Office for National Statistics along with a QGIS and R course and more foundational content)
