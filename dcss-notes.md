# Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Notes

- `Ctrl-P` reads old messages.
- Press `X` to view the map. `<Enter>` or `.` will travel to the location of
  the cursor.
- "XL" means "experience level".
- `o` does automatic exploration, though, even with safeguards it could be
  dangerous.
- `C` closes doors.
- Ranged weapons no longer require ammunition, and the ranged weapon brand
  affects the infinite amount of ammunition that you get. However, ranged
  weapons are weaker than melee weapons, and suffer penalties when wearing heavy
  armor.
- `.` manually waits one turn; `5` waits up to 100 turns and will be
  interrupted by present danger.
- `x` enters examine mode. `+` cycles through nearby monsters and `v` examines
  them.
- `=` can be used to adjust the letters of items, spells and abilities. It may
  be especially useful in the case of spells.
- `'` switches between the weapons in inventory slots `a` and `b`.
- `Q` to quiver (including spells).
- `p` autofires what's in the quiver.
- `v` shoots a wielded missile weapon and `+` cycles targets.
- `v` can also be used to attack at range with a polearm.
- `V` to evoke items.
- `Ctrl+F` finds items and dungeon features across multiple floors and accepts
  the Boolean operators `&&`, `||` and `!!`.
- `m` views and manages skills.
- `z` to cast spells.
- `I` to display spells without casting.
- `t` to order allies.
- Heavy armor is detrimental to both missile attacks and spellcasting.
- Thrown weapons are not slowed by armor.
- `Ctrl-O` to show a list of interesting features found so far.
- `>` to pray at an altar.
- `^` to view religious standing.
- `a` to use abilities.
- `A` shows any peculiarities like unusual speed or body parts.
- Damage with long and short blades is driven by dexterity.
- `%` and `@` show additional character information that's not present on the
  main display.
- Size has various effects that could be quite important.
- `?/t` to look up status effects.
- "The usual skill advice in Crawl is to "train your killing skills to
  competency first, then train your defenses". Dodging an extra attack won't
  help if you have to use a consumable to beat every other fight. It's perfectly
  reasonable to turn Dodging off at the start, then turn it back on later on
  when you feel skilled enough at killing stuff."
- "Dodging is more effective when you have higher dexterity and you are
  wearing lighter armour. Still, even a brute in crystal plate armour will
  eventually want to train a few levels of Dodging, since the early levels of a
  skill are cheap."
