# Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Notes

- `Ctrl-P` reads old messages.
- Press `X` to view the map. `<Enter>` or `.` will travel to the location of
  the cursor.
- "XL" means "experience level".
- `o` does automatic exploration, though, even with safeguards it could be
  dangerous.
- `C` closes doors.
- Ranged weapons no longer require ammunition, and the ranged weapon brand
  affects the infinite amount of ammunition that you get. However, ranged
  weapons are weaker than melee weapons, and suffer penalties when wearing heavy
  armor.
- `.` manually waits one turn; `5` waits up to 100 turns and will be
  interrupted by present danger.
- `x` enters examine mode. `+` cycles through nearby monsters and `v` examines
  them.
- `=` can be used to adjust the letters of items, spells and abilities. It may
  be especially useful in the case of spells.
- `'` switches between the weapons in inventory slots `a` and `b`.
- `Q` to quiver (including spells).
- `p` autofires what's in the quiver.
- `v` shoots a wielded missile weapon and `+` cycles targets.
- `v` can also be used to attack at range with a polearm.
- `V` to evoke items.
- `Ctrl+F` finds items and dungeon features across multiple floors and accepts
  the Boolean operators `&&`, `||` and `!!`.
- `m` views and manages skills.
- `z` to cast spells.
- `I` to display spells without casting.
- `t` to order allies.
- Heavy armor is detrimental to both missile attacks and spellcasting.
- Thrown weapons are not slowed by armor.
- `Ctrl-O` to show a list of interesting features found so far.
- `>` to pray at an altar.
- `^` to view religious standing.
- `a` to use abilities.
- `A` shows any peculiarities like unusual speed or body parts.
- `A` includes mutations. For the most part you will want to avoid mutations.
- Damage with long and short blades is driven by dexterity.
- Long blades can no longer riposte.
- `%` and `@` show additional character information that's not present on the
  main display.
- Size has various effects that could be quite important.
- `?/t` to look up status effects.
- "The usual skill advice in Crawl is to "train your killing skills to
  competency first, then train your defenses". Dodging an extra attack won't
  help if you have to use a consumable to beat every other fight. It's perfectly
  reasonable to turn Dodging off at the start, then turn it back on later on
  when you feel skilled enough at killing stuff."
- "Dodging is more effective when you have higher dexterity and you are
  wearing lighter armour. Still, even a brute in crystal plate armour will
  eventually want to train a few levels of Dodging, since the early levels of a
  skill are cheap."
- "If you're short on gold for some particularly interesting commodity, you
  can place it onto your shopping list. The game will interrupt you when you
  have collected enough gold to finally purchase an item on that list. You can
  read the shopping list in the game with '$'."
- One has to keep on moving to avoid incurring the wrath of Zot. Zot's
  presence is stronger in the Hells and their Vestibule but cannot enter the
  Abyss at all.
- `?%` shows the aptitude table.
- Skill training can be emphasized with extra selection on the skill training
  screen.
- Treat uniques and statues with special caution.
- Willpower affects chance to resist Hexes "and similar effects".
- Spells and special abilities can be canceled under certain circumstances.
  For example, silencing makes getting divine assistance impossible for as
  long as it applies.
- "In most equipment-related prompts and menus, the `;` key is a shortcut for
  'last unequipped item,' meaning the armour, jewelry or weapon you most
  recently took off or unwielded."
- Shields do not typically increase AC or EV but work with their own Shields
  skill. Increased Shields diminish penalties for using them.
- `[` gives a quick summary of armor.
- `"` shows worn jewelry.
- Octopodes can wear as many as **eight** rings as compared to the normal two.
- "There are a number of types of magical staves, each attuned to a different
  class of spells. While wielded they greatly increase the power of that
  class of spells. They can even be used in melee combat, although with
  mediocre effectiveness unless you can harness their special power, using a
  combination of the Evocations skill and the skill specific to the staff's
  type."
- "Some magical armours have special powers. These powers are sometimes
  automatic, affecting you whenever you wear the armour, and sometimes must
  be activated with the `a` command."
- Abbreviations for species and backgrounds can be found within the manual.
- Fighting skill increases HP over time.
- "Being good at a specific weapon improves the speed with which you attack
  with it. Both the base speed and the best (lowest) possible speed are
  displayed in the inventory entry for a weapon."
- "Although lighter weapons are easier to use initially, as they strike
  quickly and accurately, heavier weapons increase in damage potential very
  quickly as you improve your skill with them."
- "Axes are able to cleave through multiple enemies in a single swing, hitting
  enemies in an arc around the wielder with every attack."
- "Polearms can reach farther and allow the wielder to attack an opponent two
  squares away, and even reach over monsters. Use the `v` command to target a
  specific monster with a reaching attack, or use Autofight (`<Tab>`) to reach
  automatically. \[The latter is not advisable.\]"
- "Targeted attacks with your primary weapon, including attacking non-adjacent
  monsters with a polearm, or firing a wielded launcher (regardless of the state
  of the main quiver).
- "Finally, Unarmed Combat skill increases the accuracy, damage, and speed of
  attacks made while unarmed. Note that most auxiliary attacks, such as an
  Armataur's tail-slap or a Minotaur's headbutt, are not affected by Unarmed
  Combat. The only exception is the off-hand punch attack granted by using
  neither weapon nor shield, which Unarmed Combat makes somewhat more
  effective."
- Spellcasting skill increases MP and spell levels.
- Armor skill slightly reduces the armor penalty for spellcasting.
- Heavy armor penalizes Stealth.
- Stealth can enable backstabbing but is more applicable for evading enemies,
  including those who were aware of your presence but lost line-of-sight
  contact.
- Backstabbing works best with daggers, then diminishes in strength with Felid
  claws and short blades, and is least useful with any other weapon.
- Not all gods require skill Invocations, or rely on a different skill for
  their divine abilities.
- Invocations _can_ increase maximum magic reserves. (Only the largest benefit
  from Spellcasting and Invocations is chosen.)
