# Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Notes

* `Ctrl-P` reads old messages.
* Press `X` to view the map. `<Enter>` or `.` will travel to the location of
the cursor.
* "XL" means "experience level".
* "o" does automatic exploration, though, even with safeguards it could be
dangerous.
* "C" closes doors.
* Ranged weapons no longer require ammunition, and the ranged weapon brand
affects the infinite amount of ammunition that you get. However, ranged
weapons are weaker than melee weapons, and suffer penalties when wearing heavy
armor.
* `.` manually waits one turn; `5` waits up to 100 turns and will be
interrupted by present danger.
* `x` enters examine mode. `+` cycles through nearby monsters and `v` examines
them.
* `=` can be used to adjust the letters of items, spells and abilities. It may
be especially useful in the case of spells.
* `'` switches between the weapons in inventory slots `a` and `b`.
* `Q` to quiver (including spells).
* `v` shoots a wielded missile weapon and `+` cycles targets.
* `v` can also be used to attack at range with a polearm.
* `V` to evoke items.
* `Ctrl+F` finds items and dungeon features across multiple floors and accepts
the Boolean operators `&&`, `||` and `!!`.
* `m` views and manages skills.
* `z` to cast spells.
* `I` to display spells without casting.
* `t` to order allies.
* Heavy armor is detrimental to both missile attacks and spellcasting.
* Thrown weapons are not slowed by armor.
* `Ctrl-O` to show a list of interesting features found so far.
* `>` to pray at an altar.
* `^` to view religious standing.
* `a` to use abilities.
