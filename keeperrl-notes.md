# KeeperRL Notes

## Dungeon Keeper meets Dwarf Fortress

* Scout your starting area before beginning to dig.
* On the ground floor, make a serpentine entrance passageway that can be
fitted with traps later then a short passage where a pair of staircases
can be used to access the rest of the mountain. Start building the base proper
on Z-level one with a grand "reception hall" that has guard zones (possibly
warriors closest to entrance, then healers, then archers as suggested in one
post).
* Save scumming is possible.
* "f" to shoot arrows.
* Turn off minion abuse on your Keeper to avoid accidentally getting involved
in a kerfuffle.
* Magma forges etc. can greatly increase the power of your units.
* Crafting around enchanted pools should not be left unattended.
* Zombies (and other undead?) don't ever heal, at least with a Classic Keeper.
* Vampires can heal by feasting on their enemies (if they still have a head).
* If you lose imps you can recruit for free up to the original four.
* There's an order available to prioritize tasks.
* Remember that speed is configurable.
* 7x7 rooms are very decent for most purposes but I use 13x13 for archery
targets.
* Don't forget to replace lost units in your group(s) using the grouping
interface. (And also don't forget assignment to guard duty when gaining new
types of units.)
* Hoarded gold brings envy.
* Areas shown as "defeated" may still have secondary enemies left behind.
* The first few negative Z-levels are a good source of resources and
experience early in the game. (Or maybe even about a dozen?)
* Prisoners require two prison tiles each but no population slots.
* After capturing prisoners it is important to "recruit" them on time.
* Prisoners are often better workers than imps and can carry out construction
(and crafting?) work without being converted. In fact, they will cease to do
these things after being converted.
* A torture table is required to convert prisoners.
* Converting prisoners may be a better way of acquiring quality fighters than
just recruiting them outright.
* "Quality over quantity" does apply to your units to a large degree.
* Withdraw wounded units to heal them so they can gain more experience.
* Zombie brains are alchemical ingredients.
* Remember full control can be used for difficult battles.
* Beware of the possibility of a zombie vault in game. My first one occurred
at Z-level 8, as was seen in a Steam discussion thread. (Do they always occur
there? (Yes.)) There are double doors across a river of lava that contains
something like 50 zombies behind it. Zombies have the "swarming" trait which
makes the whole more powerful than the sum of its parts. I dug in the side
rather than attack frontally, which was accidental but might be the best way
to approach the vault. The vault will gradually get weaker as you destroy more
of the zombies and they do not appear to give chase. Ultimately one of my
Harpies acted on her own initiative and ended up slaughtering the entire
remainder of the vault's inhabitants.
* Your Keeper can benefit from the "bypass allies" skill.
* Chickens can be controlled and used as scouts while incurring little risk.
* Getting XP for your Keeper is very important.
* Piling up titles on your Keeper (by killing enemy leaders apparently) can be
quite powerful.
* Units can be dragged from the population screen to a visible location on the
map.
* Broken thrones (and presumably other thrones) can be claimed. Watch out for
spawned enemies.
* To mount a steed, control a unit and approach the steed. Then right-click to
mount.
* To see who needs their own private quarters, look for "Unrealized experience".
* To make use of insane craftsmen, lock them in a workshop room so they can
create things then lock them in a sequestration room so that their items can
be picked up.
* When creating guard posts, assign a number less than the size of your entire
army so guards can rotate out and perform other duties.
* Leisure area can be used as a "default guard zone".
* Healing totems might be useful in the reception hall.
* Barricades might also be useful.
