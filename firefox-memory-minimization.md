# Reduce the Memory Usage of Firefox

There are many ways to do this but, as of Firefox Quantum 57, the best ways 
appear to be:

* Going into Preferences and then finding the Performance section and then
reduce "Content process limit" to some value or another.
* Going into about:memory, performing garbage and cycle collection and also
clicking "Memorize memory usage"
