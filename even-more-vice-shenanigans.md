# Even More VICE Shenanigans
## Getting my gamepad to work

I got this generic SNES wireless gamepad. It does work with VICE even though I
was terrible at the first game I tried. Once I had it charged up and paired
with the USB receiver, I was able to play my first game, *Commando* (which is
allegedly quite easy). It was necessary to set the gamepad to port 2 rather
than port 1 and proceeding required pressing the "Run/Stop" button, which
happens to be Escape as of the current version of VICE. (No, wasn't it Space?)
