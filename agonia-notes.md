# Agonia Notes

- Inventory drops on death.
- "Characters on the map show as the first two letters of their name.
  Underlined names or initials mean the player is currently online."
- "Each step costs you move points depending on the terrain type and your
  race's affinity for said terrain."
- "If \[Discussion\] symbol blinks, someone is talking to you in local chat.
  Local chat range is 5 tiles. To discuss with players outside of this range,
  use the Game chat link (discord channel)."
- "The best way to train crafting skills is by crafting items. The best way to
  train weapon skills is by finding fights outside of the capital. You can find
  fights when moving on the map, but the most efficient way is to use the
  'Explore' function (costs 1 turn)."
- "When fighting (creatures or other players), rounds happen automatically
  every 15 seconds. That gives you time to decide what to do for the following
  round (keep attacking, flee, cast a spell, change target, use an item etc.).
  Fight rounds do not cost you any turn or move point."
- "There are two factions waging a war (the Order & the Forsaken). You are
  automatically affiliated to your race's faction but you are free to change if
  you wish, or to join the Free Folks (neutrals)."
- "Improving your general and weapon skills gives you EVO points. EVO points
  can be used to upgrade stats like strength, agility, health etc. Use the link
  'Evolve' in your character sheet."
- "You can join a Group. Groups belonging to the same faction are allied.
  Groups can build Towns on the map, with several Buildings (Watch tower,
  Dwellings, etc). Factions work like mini-societies and some Groups specialize
  in Welcoming and training new settlers."
- "You can find fights in two ways: by moving - each step has a 10-15% chance
  of initiating a fight and by exploring turns - each turn has a 20-25% chance
  of initiating a fight. In addition, exploring also yields items such as herbs
  which can be used to craft potions later on."
- "When you kill a creature, they sometimes drop one or more items like hides,
  bones, or guts. When you go back to your Main Page after your fight is
  finished, you can pick some or all of these items by clicking on them. Now go
  walk around and explore on the mountain here (not in town though you cannot
  find monsters). Caracals and skeevers are likely to drop hides, bones and
  guts, so hunt there until you manage to get the ingredients you need."
- Which enemy NPCs can be encountered is dependent on location and terrain
  type.
- The pinned messages in `#order-newbie-help` on Discord are very useful.
- PvP is not optional.
- Let other members of your faction know where you are going in case of likely
  enemy attacks.
- Skadi, mayor of the capital of New Heaven, says "We've got chat, trades,
  planning, work orders, scouting, and advice" in the Discord.
- A fort icon on the map means a town has been founded there.
- "To see an even larger map, you can utilize the Look Around link to attain
  your max view range. How far you can see is determined by race, terrain, and
  any buildings that may be on your tile. Standing on a mountain increases your
  view range a little, while standing in a forest will lower it. Capitol cities,
  and some group towns have built watchtowers, which give you large vision range
  bonuses."
- "The only truly safe places in the world are capitol cities, but even those
  can be compromised if a ruthless or cruel mayor is elected. We'll talk more
  about elections later, but know that they are important!"
- "Every time you move one step, there is a small chance of spawning creatures
  that will attack you. Around the capitol, they are rather easy to get rid of,
  but as you stray further from the city, some deadly beasts roam the island.
  You may also see numbers on the map, which represent monsters that other
  players have ran into, then fled from battle with, or perished to. Monsters
  appear as numbers representing the sum amount of monsters on the tile. If you
  step onto these tiles, the monsters left behind will attack you, but your
  movement onto the tile may spawn even more additional monsters. In some areas,
  a pile of 11 monsters may be manageable, but in other areas, even 1 may be a
  feat to take down. Clicking on a pile will give you information on what
  monster is inside it."
- When you see (for example), armor rated "4/7/4", those values (higher is
  better) refer to resistance against slashing, piercing and blunt attacks,
  respectively.
- Descriptions of the various skills:
  - Masonry: This skill will be useful if you want to build a town for your
    group. A town can have several buildings to serve as storage, watch tower,
    blacksmith etc. Each building will require materials and some masonry work.
  - Medicine: This skill will enable you to heal your allies better.
  - Blacksmithing: Used to craft weapons, armors and shields using different
    types of ores extracted.
  - Tailoring: Used to craft items and armors with hides, furs, scales or
    bones.
  - Woodworking: Used to craft items and weapons with wood. Also used to cut
    logs in the forest which is the base material for any wooden object
    (including town buildings).
  - Stoneworking: Used to craft items and weapons with stone. Also used to cut
    raw stone from the mountains which is the base material for any stone object
    (including town buildings).
  - Leadership: This skill represents the notoriety of your character. You can
    increase your leadership skill by completing quests, killing enemy players,
    winning tournaments or special events.
  - Fleeing: Allows you to flee from a fight.
  - Seeking: This skill has two key functions: it allows you to find items
    more frequently when exploring, and it helps you block an enemy who is
    trying to flee from you.
  - Alchemy: Used to craft all types of potions.
  - Runic: Allows you to use runes on your items. Runes are very rare and
    precious stones that you can get during special events. They can add damage
    to a weapon, elemental protection to an armor or physical protection to a
    shield.
  - Sorcery: Used to catch the spirit of a creature when you kill it. Spirits
    can then be used to craft essences which can confer special powers to some
    items like rings, earrings or necklaces.
- Regarding the character sheet:
  - "On the left you can see the total Damage values of your current equipped
    weapon. A weapon may have a base damage spread of 10-14 damage or so, but
    when equipped, it takes into account your Weapon Skill and Strength to give
    a higher minimum and max damage. You can also see your Attack Power, which
    is compared to the enemy's Defense Power to determine how often you will
    land an attack. Higher tier weapons will grant higher attack bonuses along
    with higher damage."
  - "You can also see your Protection totals against certain types of damage
    (Slicing, Piercing, Blunt) which we'll go into more later on in the combat
    section. Put simply, these are flat reductions to the damage you'll take
    during combat, and it's possible to reduce damage all the way to 0, meaning
    your armor is strong enough to completely absorb a blow."
  - "You'll also see your Defense Power, which will be compared to the enemy's
    Attack Power to determine how often they will land an attack on you. Higher
    tier armors and shields will give more Defense Power than lower ones, and in
    general have stronger protection values."
  - "Last on the defensive side, you'll see the Elemental Resistances. These
    are totals based on your Will stat, or the rare magical items called Runes
    that can be applied to your armor. Fire Runes would increase your fire
    resistance, and so on. Certain attacks by enemies don’t have a slicing,
    piercing, or blunt damage type, but instead an elemental one, such as fire,
    poison, or acid. This is where Elemental Resistances come in. If you have a
    20% resistance to an element, incoming attacks of that type will do 20% less
    damage."
- Regarding armor:
  - "Scale armors specialize in Slicing protection, with decent values in
    piercing, but lower blunt protection."
  - "Leather armors specialize in Piercing protection, with somewhat decent
    values in slashing and blunt."
  - "Bone armors specialize in Blunt protection, with decent values in
    slashing, but lower piercing protection."
  - "Metal armors such as Chainmails and Platemails offer more balanced
    protection, with above-decent protection from all three forms of damage,
    though it specializes in nothing."
- Shields can supplement armor and both can be enchanted with runes, in
  addition to weapons.
- "Common comfreys can be explored in all plains and you can find parsley
  roots in all mountains. Everytime you explore on a spot, you have a chance of
  finding ingredients. However, fertility of tiles is not endless! So if you
  explore too much on a same spot, it becomes sterile. When looking for
  ingredients it is more productive to change spot regularly (like every 10-15
  explores) to optimize your yield. You can see the status of the fertility
  (from Exhausted to Abundant) of the spot you are in on your Main Page."
