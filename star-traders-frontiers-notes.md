# Star Traders: Frontiers Notes
## Notes on the Trese Brothers' turn-based Elite clone

* My custom template is currently a Military Officer with Attributes at A (16
  Strength, 18 Charisma, 24 Quickness, 26 Wisdom, 26 Fortitude, 26
  Resilience), Skills at B (5 Pistols, 5 Doctor, 5 Command), Experience at C,
  Ship at D (Juror Class) and Contacts at E (Gestalt Explorer)
* My captain is Military Officer/Doctor/Combat Medic and my starting officers
  are Doctor/Combat Medic/Pistoleer, Engineer/Mechanic/Spy and Quartermaster,
  Commander/Military Officer
* Leaving behind stashes on good Wilderness zones is a good way to mark them
  out.
* The same ship combat talent can be used more than once if in sore need.
* Weapons Locker A6 is the highest attainable component of the type but
  requires special qualifications to attain.
* Queue upgrades in a new ship while carrying out errands in your existing
  ship.
* Revised Captain with Dragoon Cruiser (Ship Level at A) with Attributes at B
  (16 Strength, 16 Charisma, 22 Quickness, Wisdom 24, Fortitude 22, Resilience
  22) and Skills at C (4 Command, 4 Doctor).
* Officers added to the initial staff mentioned earlier on a Sword
  Battlecruiser are Scientist/Commander/Zealot and Smuggler/Assassin/Saboteur.
