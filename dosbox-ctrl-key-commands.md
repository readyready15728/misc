# DOSBox Ctrl Key Functions Not Working
## What the hell

I just ran into this and after some frantic Googling I discovered that the
issue could be fixed by doing Ctrl + "Meta" (in this case the Windows key) +
[function key] on my Samsung laptop. I learned this from someone on the DOSBox
forum with only five posts rather than any of the developers or senior users:

How this person figured it out and why I have to do this is still utterly
beyond me as I have yet to find other references to this quirk.

(*EDIT*: figured it out; it was because Xfce4 was already binding those keys.)
