# Linux+ Practice Quiz Scorecard
## Not even doing a subtitle for this one; you already know (XKO-004)

I took this one:

https://www.itexams.com/exam/XK0-004

Here are my answers and how I responded to getting things right or wrong:

1. In order to comply with new security policies, an administrator needs to prevent the SSH server from using insecure algorithms.
Which of the following files should be edited to accomplish this?

    A. `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`  
    B. `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`  
    C. `~/.ssh/ssh_config`  
    D. `/etc/ssh/known_hosts`  
    
    A, easy. I've had to set up X11 forwarding before. **CORRECT**

2. Which of the following configuration files should be modified to disable Ctrl+Alt+Del in Linux?

    A. `/etc/inittab`  
    B. `~/.bash_profile`  
    C. `/etc/securetty`  
    D. `/etc/security/limits.conf`  

    A isn't really for security. B would be obviously insecure. C has that
    nice Unix-y sound to it so I guessed that one. **WRONG**
