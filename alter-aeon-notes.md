* "Nyssra the archer says to you, 'Hey! If you're heading out into the
badlands, make sure you're healed up first! A good place to rest or sleep
is by a fire like this one! Sleeping by a nice warm fire will keep you
feeling sharp and ready for anything! Also, look out for potions you can
drink and food. A lot of potions have healing effects, and food will help
restore your health and stamina. Take this potion and drink it if your
health gets low!'"
* "FYI: The warmth of the fire will help you recover more quickly from battle.
Resting or sleeping near fires will give you a boost to regeneration. If
you sleep long enough, you will become sharp. While sharp, your base
regeneration is boosted, and you will gain slightly more experience, in
addition to other benefits. You do not need a fire to become sharp, but one
will help you become sharp more quickly."

ones that slice , slash or chop. If you don't seem to be hurting a creature
