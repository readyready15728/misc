* "Our healer managed to scrape together a waypoint just outside of my hut.
Don't forget to 'pray here' so you can 'recall' back to the camp."
* "As you find waypoints, you can add them to your waypoint list with
'waypoint set' or 'pray here'. You can travel between waypoints you have on
your list, see 'waypoint help' for more information."
* "Nyssra the archer says to you, 'Hey! If you're heading out into the
badlands, make sure you're healed up first! A good place to rest or sleep
is by a fire like this one! Sleeping by a nice warm fire will keep you
feeling sharp and ready for anything! Also, look out for potions you can
drink and food. A lot of potions have healing effects, and food will help
restore your health and stamina. Take this potion and drink it if your
health gets low!'"
* "FYI: The warmth of the fire will help you recover more quickly from battle.
Resting or sleeping near fires will give you a boost to regeneration. If
you sleep long enough, you will become sharp. While sharp, your base
regeneration is boosted, and you will gain slightly more experience, in
addition to other benefits. You do not need a fire to become sharp, but one
will help you become sharp more quickly."

and resistant to others. For example, skeletons are difficult to harm with
edged and pointed weapons, but are vulnerable to blunt weapons that pound or
crush. Blobs are resistant to blunt weapons, but take extra damage from edged
ones that slice , slash or chop. If you don't seem to be hurting a creature
very much, try the 'consider' command. It will give you information about
their resistances and vulnerabilities. There are also help pages for damage
types and creature types, see 'help creature type' and 'help basic damage' for
