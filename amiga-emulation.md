# Amiga Emulation
## Getting Amiga software to run on modern hardware

* Log in to OAGD / Open Retro on FS-UAE Launcher to gain access to the many
database entries for Amiga games with their associated downloads.
* It does not appear to be possible to delete game entries in FS-UAE Launcher
because changes made to the local .ini file and SQLite database will be
updated on next login from the server. However, if you delete local floppy disk
images containing a certain game and need to restore them, put them in the
FS-UAE downloads directory and do Update File Database.
* Install Kickstart ROMs for better compatibility. The replacement ROM can
only go so far. In particular, for gaming, 1.3 and 3.1, I was once told, are
especially important.
* The Amiga 500 was the most popular of the series. It's a sensible default
for settings and searches for documentation.
* FS-UAE Launcher actually includes a save disk for each configuration so you
don't have to set your own up, assuming everything can fit on it. To use it,
hit F12 and use one of the empty slots under Removable Media. (N.b. there has
to *be* an empty slot in the first place. If your game uses two floppies then
you need to add at least one more floppy drive to use this feature.)
* If the floppy sounds annoy you, you can turn those off in the full settings
menu.
* Clean Up and Snapshot are useful features of the Amiga Workbench for
arranging icons. (Hint: right click with window in question focused and
navigate to menu.) Clean Up will arrange the icons into a grid and Snapshot
will "freeze" the current position of icons that have been selected.
* Screenshot directory can be changed in Advanced Setting in FS-UAE Launcher
with, say, `screenshots_output_dir = ~/Pictures`.
* `joystick_port_1 = nothing` needs to be in settings for the cursor keys to
function properly. This is recommended to be used on a per-config basis only,
not globally.
* The default color palette in Workbench is ugly. On Workbench 2.x, at least,
this can be changed by going into Colors under Tools and using the following
palette: EEE, 898, 131, 282 for a nice green theme. Something similar, but even
better, can be done in 3.x by going to Prefs and then Palette but here decimal
RGB triplets are used: (237, 237, 237), (18, 50, 18), (136, 153, 136), (34,
136, 34). Then for enhanced legibility, assign the colors to the different
roles as follows:
    * Important Text: #4
    * Bright Edges: #3
    * Dark Edges: #2
    * Active Window Title Bars: #4
    * Active Window Titles: #1
    * Menu Background: #2
    * Menu Text: #1

    Finally click Save.

    The Workbench 1.x can also be altered, but it has to be eyeballed
    because sliders with no annotation are used to set the RGB components.
    These will then be saved in an FS-UAE save state. (Presumably WinUAE
    does the same.)
* Populous appears not to cooperate well with any version of Workbench and
should just be run on its own; the same may be true of other games. (What if
it's an issue of not enough memory? Perhaps this could be configured around.
Would WHDLoad fix it maybe?)
* Consider installing ClassicWB? (What are the real advantages?)
* If a program bugs you about the lack of an FPU, then use custom configuration
to set `fpu` to one of the options that you can find in
`src/fs-uae/config-hardware.c` in the FS-UAE source. (Look for the variable
`uae_fpu_model` to see your options. Alternatively, you can change the CPU in
FS-UAE Launcher because CPU settings entail FPU settings.
* [WhichAmiga](http://aminet.net/package/util/moni/WhichAmiga) can be
incredibly useful for diagnostic purposes; it gives all major data about your
(emulated) hardware and software.
* Use `EndCLI` to quit a running instance of AmigaDOS.
* Installed libraries go in the top-level `Libs` folder.
* If you installed a library already and a program is still bugging you about
it not being there, try alternative versions of the same. Also use the Linux
program `strings` to see what other libraries it might require.
* Just because it's there in the file system doesn't mean Workbench sees it.
Workbench needs an .info file to see things. The utility
[AddIcon](http://aminet.net/package/util/wb/AddIcon) can help with this.
(Actually, no, that wasn't quite right: Workbench *can* see the entire
contents of a directory if you go to Window → Show → All Files. I still need
to figure out getting associations sorted out properly if it can be done,
though.)
* `/` means "parent directory", the same as `..` does everywhere else in
computing today.
* `PATH` can be used to add to the search path in a single AmigaDOS instance;
`ASSIGN` can be used to add to it globally. (For more information on that,
see [here](http://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/AmigaOS_Manual:_AmigaDOS_Command_Examples#Changing_the_Search_Path).
If spaces appear in the path, remember to use double quotes. Additionally,
such statements need to be added to `SYS:S/User-Startup` to persist over
multiple boots of the operating system.
* `MAKEDIR` is the equivalent of `mkdir`.
* `RENAME` does move operations. It can be even be used with the target
filename omitted, like so: `RENAME file directory`.
* If you enable emulation of the Toccata sound card and install
`toccata.library` (see [here](http://aminet.net/package/util/libs/toclib12),
the CPU appears to be relieved of some of the burden of playing sound
(presumably because of the DSP) for playing software that supports Toccata.
What this means, for example, is that, for me,
[Eagleplayer](http://bax.comlab.uni-rostock.de/~bj/software/eagleplayer/) will
play .wav files normally under my install of Workbench 3.1 on Amiga 1200 if
Toccata Amplifier is enabled but MP3 playback continues to stutter and lock up
the system. :( I'm still looking into what can be done about this. (Issue
apparently resolved; see below.)
* The following very, *very* specific constellation of FS-UAE settings enables
virtually perfect MP3 playback in Eagleplayer, for me at least:
    * JIT enabled
    * 68040-NOMMU CPU chosen (because JIT doesn't support MMU anyway)
    * Toccata emulation enabled
    * `toccata.library` installed in `Libs`
    * Toccata Amplifier enabled
* If you see an install script written in what looks like some kind of Lisp,
you need [Installer](http://aminet.net/package/util/misc/Installer-43_3) or one
of the other implementations of the same to run it.
* Motherboard and Zorro III memory can apparently be used to go over and above
what FS-UAE will support in fast RAM.
* FS-UAE can work with .dms demo files directly, but they don't necessarily
play along well with Workbench.
* `Ctrl-C` can be used in the CLI to terminate an Amiga binary (though it may not
have effect, at least immediately); the equivalent for an AmigaDOS script is
`Ctrl-D`.
* There are a number of other useful keyboard shortcuts in the CLI for some
versions of Workbench:
    * `Ctrl`-W: deletes one word backwards
    * `Ctrl`-X: deletes entire current line
    * `Ctrl`-K: "kills" to end of line
    * `Ctrl`-Y: pastes kill buffer
    * `Ctrl`-U: deletes backwards to start of line
    * `Ctrl`-S: suspends output
    * `Ctrl`-Q: resumes output
    * `Ctrl`-\: ends CLI instance (`Ctrl`-\ is also more generally the EOF
      character)
* Universal wildcard on Amiga is #?, not \*. (\* stands for the keyboard
and current screen; for example `COPY filename to *` will print contents
of said file to console.)
* "To instruct Amiga DOS to search through the directories from the root
(top-level) directory of a volume (disk or partition), you type a colon (:)
at the beginning of the file description."
* "As you know, prefacing a file description with a colon serves to identify
the root directory of the current drive. However, to give the root directory
of a specific drive, you precede the colon with the drive name. Thus, you have
yet another way of specifying the file 'data' in directory 'mary', that is
'DF1:mary/data'."
* The volume name of a disk is an abstract one independent of its physical
device name and can be used instead of the device name.
* "In addition to the aforementioned physical devices, AmigaDOS supports a
variety of useful logical devices. AmigaDOS uses these devices to find the
files that your programs require from time to time. (So that your programs can
refer to a standard device name regardless of where the file actually is.) All
of these 'logical devices' may be reassigned by you to reference any
directory.)"
* `RUN` carries out a command in the background.
* `EXECUTE` carries out an AmigaDOS script.
* `>` and `>>` function as in Unix(-like) systems.
* A few remarks on documentation for AmigaDOS commands:

    In a command *format* listing:

    * Angle brackets denote necessary arguments
    * Square brackets denote optional arguments
    * Curly bois denote arguments of which there can be one or several
    * The vertical bar denotes a set of mutually exclusive options

    In a command *template* listing:

    * /A: always required
    * /K: keyword required, if supplied
    * /S: switch, must be supplied to be turned on
    * /N: numerical argument
    * /M: multiple arguments accepted
    * /F: final argument
    * =: indicates different forms of the same argument

    More information on all that here: http://wiki.amigaos.net/wiki/AmigaOS_Manual:_AmigaDOS_Command_Reference#Command_Documentation
* When the demo Hardwired asks for the second disk and you insert it,
right-click to continue.
* For some weird, utterly inexplicable reason, the Aminet package
[muiusr38](http://aminet.net/package/util/libs/mui38usr) has two directories
`mui` and `MUI` that the operating system of course can't fully tell apart. The
Installer script will not run unless the two binaries from `mui` are moved or
copied into `MUI`. `mui` should then be renamed or deleted so that you can
enter the directory with all the other good stuff and run the Installer script.
After this is done the installation will run without a hitch.
* To install the [improved
  Installer](http://aminet.net/package/util/sys/Installer) by Guido Mersmann,
have the original Installer installed first, then install that MUI library I
just talked about, then unpack the improved Installer and do `NewInstaller
Install`. (Don't bother with installing languages other than English; it seems
to lead to an aborted install. Also it seems Mersmann's installer hangs on
some install scripts??)
* The Installer script that comes with
  [JPEG-DT](http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/JPEG-DT) illustrates how to
install datatypes in general, manually or otherwise. Briefly:
    * Datatypes as such go in `SYS:Classes/DataTypes`
    * Descriptor files go in `DEVS:DataTypes`
    * Preferences go in `SYS:Prefs/DataTypes`
* When you install
[Picasso96](http://aminet.net/package/driver/video/Picasso96) and it asks for
`Work:` that's apparently a default name for the hard drive. Typically `ASSIGN
Work: DH0:` can solve this issue (barring possibilities with multiple hard
drives). Additionally that command needs to go into `SYS:S/User-Startup`.
* I have no idea why, but the Linux version of `lha` doesn't always extract all
the files in an lha archive. I have had better luck with the [lha
extractor](http://aminet.net/package/util/arc/lha) on Aminet in one instance
at least.
* Good commentary on setting image backgrounds here:
http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=48274
* To read documentation in AmigaGuide format, install
  [aguide34](http://aminet.net/package/text/hyper/aguide34).
* For just any old picture to work with WBPattern, the background-setting
utility, the following steps must be taken, at least in FS-UAE:
    1. Emulate an Amiga 4000 with Workbench 3.1. (Other configurations may
       work, but this is what I used and it's top-of-the-line.)
    2. Graphics card UAEGFX must be enabled in the configuration.
    3. Increase fast RAM to 8 MB, which will allow larger images to be
       used.
    4. Install [Picasso96](http://aminet.net/package/driver/video/Picasso96).
    5. Install required datatypes.
       [JPEG-DT](http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/JPEG-DT) and
       [PNGdt44](http://aminet.net/package/util/dtype/PNGdt44) should be
       adequate for most purposes.
    6. Go into Prefs and select a UAE screenmode. The default window size
       in FS-UAE is 960x540, so "960x540 32bit RBGA" is typically a
       sensible choice.

    Then you should be able to put nearly whatever you want in the background.
    WBPattern will tile images that are too small to fill the whole screen.
    One other very important thing to take into consideration is that it
    appears to be possible for some images to be too large for WBPattern.
    Step 3 in the process should ameliorate this to some degree. It has for me
    in at least one test instance. But I'd be surprised if it were a silver
    bullet.
* [DCTelnet](http://aminet.net/package/comm/tcp/DCTelnet_16) will hang if
screen mode is changed *during* a connection. To change the screen mode
in fact, open DCTelnet, *do not* start a connection, change the screen mode,
quit, and restart with the new screen mode. *Then* make a connection.
