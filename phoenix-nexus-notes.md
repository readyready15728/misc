# Phoenix Nexus Notes

- "Positions refer to all the in game entities that can be run by players.
  These include ships, ground parties, debris, cargo dumps, starbases, outposts,
  agents, operatives and platforms. They all can have orders issued to them and
  receive turns."
- "Each time a set of orders is submitted via the Nexus Order Editor a turn is
  uploaded to the nexus on the next working day with all the results from the
  ship's orders and a manifest for the ship."
- "Orders are submitted with the nexus order editor, which is part of this
  site. Orders are used to control what positions do. They are queued by the
  user and collected every morning ~7am GMT."
- "Each order takes a number of TUs (time units) to process and each day a
  position accumulates 60TUs (up to a maximum of 300TU) which allow orders to be
  run."
- "After you press complete on this page the system will create you a new ship
  within the game and you will be required to complete the first starter mission
  before you can continue. This starter mission will guide the creation of your
  first ship and issue a few orders for it. You will receive an update for this
  ship on the next working day after sending the orders. At this stage you will
  need to get to grips with the game as best you can and the easiest way to do
  this is to post on the forum to ask any questions you might have. Existing
  players are very good at answering most questions."
- Other things you should be looking to do:
  - Have a look at your new ship in ('Turns' page on the 'Find' tab) and press
    on the ship displayed.
  - Enter some orders for the ship you have, some will be automatically added
    as the result of the starter mission you have been given.
  - Look through the possible affiliations to join; joining an active
    affiliation is the best way to progress in the game as they will be able to
    help you with both information and materials (like new ships).
  - Work through the mission that will be presented to you.
  - Have a browse through the 'Library' page and have a look through the
    various tabs there.
- "As you progressed through this mission, the choices you made produced
  orders for your ship. These orders, for example, naming your officer, were
  transferred to the order section of the website. So far in this mission, you
  have recruited an officer, designated the species for your crew and created a
  ship and named it. If you now go to the order tab, you will see most of those
  orders (some are processed as part of the mission). You now have the
  opportunity to edit them, should you wish. After this, all you need to do is
  send them. They will be processed on the next working day. Most orders in the
  game are processed by adding a turn and processing orders for a position /
  ship."
- "Please follow this link, to send your orders. **Press the turn to edit it
  and press 'send turns' to complete the mission.**"
- "When you have sent the turn, you need to navigate back to this page by
  pressing 'Orders' on the top tab and then selecting 'Missions'."
- "Your turn on the nexus has also been updated with the ship that you chose."
- "The best source of information about the game are other players. The
  phoenix community is quite helpful and they usually try to help new
  players."
