* "Well done discovering a hidden exit! There are many hidden locations around
the realm that can be discovered by examining your surroundings with the 'look
around' command or examining the room description. Our builders enjoy keeping
you on your toes, so keep in mind that not all keywords may appear when
looking around. You may need to examine one keyword to find that another
hidden keyword exists. Luckily, you will be notified when you discover hidden
keywords, and once you do, they too will appear on 'look around'. Something
that may help you in your explorations is the command 'mudpie hidden'. This
command will confirm whether or not there is a hidden exit or keyword in the
room. It won't tell you where to look, just that the room requires further
examination."

the chance to catch you unawares and get in the first hit. The deter spell
is a useful buff that will protect you against these mobs, allowing you to
walk by them peacefully (unless they are much higher level than you, in
which case they'll ignore deter). If you don't have access to the spell,
many players will cast buffs on you via triggers listed in their bio. To
check someone's bio, the command is 'bio <player>'."

copper ores.'

'make 1 steel', 'make 1 bronze', or 'make 1 brass'.'
