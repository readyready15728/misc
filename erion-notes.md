the realm that can be discovered by examining your surroundings with the 'look
around' command or examining the room description. Our builders enjoy keeping
you on your toes, so keep in mind that not all keywords may appear when
looking around. You may need to examine one keyword to find that another
hidden keyword exists. Luckily, you will be notified when you discover hidden
keywords, and once you do, they too will appear on 'look around'. Something
that may help you in your explorations is the command 'mudpie hidden'. This
command will confirm whether or not there is a hidden exit or keyword in the
room. It won't tell you where to look, just that the room requires further
examination."

the chance to catch you unawares and get in the first hit. The deter spell
is a useful buff that will protect you against these mobs, allowing you to
walk by them peacefully (unless they are much higher level than you, in
which case they'll ignore deter). If you don't have access to the spell,
many players will cast buffs on you via triggers listed in their bio. To
check someone's bio, the command is 'bio <player>'."

'scrape skin', then with a scraped skin, tannin, block of wood and a match
in crafting inventory, 'make 1 leather' at Leatherworkers Craft Hall and then
'get leather cauldron'. 
* Kercha says to you, 'You can make them in any order, and I'll teach you the
steps. You'll need a match, 3 chunks of coal, 1 block of wood, and of course
the ores.'
* Kercha says to you, 'To make steel, you'll need 2 iron ores. For bronze,
you'll need 1 iron and 1 copper ore, and for a bar of brass, you'll need 2
copper ores.'

* [newbie] KitKat Katenka: really depends on what you're into. If you like
storylines, there are a ton of missions (some crafting related). hillock
hills has an acolyte who can give you quite a few missions that will give you
a good overview of activities you can do in the game. questing, expeditions,
and junkyards will help you explore and earn experience or qp depending on
what you have toggle questexp set to. the areas command (optionally area
<level>) will show you places you can runto and explore
* Quests (not the same as missions), which can be found (at least) in Hillock
Hills from the Questmaster and the guess-the-word game are early ways to farm
gold.
* There is a Guildmaster in Hillock Hills for trains and practices.

* Phoenix downs will protect you from some unpleasant effects of death. (See
'guide 18'.)

starting early. Or maybe not:
* [newbie] Washaki: it's up to you, but usually i see others adding them when
they're fifty or so. i'm a Masochist, and usually weight till i actually
legend my first, then add the secondary. i wouldn't recomend it.

* Darbyn says to you, 'Alrighty, I'll be happy to bestow my knowledge of gems
upon you. You'll need 3 gems of the same condition and type, such as 3
chipped mana gems, a match, and a sulfur deposit.  Once you're ready to melt
them, say ready.'
* 'craft inventory gems'.
* 'toggle sector' to see the type of terrain you're in.
* 'mine sectors'.
* Darbyn says to you, 'To melt gems, you'll need 3 of the same condition and
type, such as 3 chipped mana gems, a sulfur deposit, and a match. Place the
materials in the cauldron and start the process with the syntax 'make gems'.'
Darbyn says to you, 'After the process is complete, the next step will be to
polish the gem.
* Polishing a gem will enhance its qualities. You can only polish certain
gems, such as gems that boost mana, hitpoints, hp regeneration, or one of
the six stats like strength, dexterity, and so on.  If your gem is one of
those kinds, try your hand at polishing it. Otherwise, return to me with a
different gem.'
* https://www.erionmud.com/gems.php
* 'craft inventory get perfect garnet'.
* 'make gems' turns three chipped gems into one flawed gem and three flawed
into one perfect.
* There is no point in polishing any grade of gems but perfect, unless to
train basic lapidary.
* 'mine survey' (one mining is mastered).
* 'craft inventory get all.flawed lazurite'.
* 'help vault'.
* [chat] Rowan: using scry, locate object, step, blink, gate, etc to help
guess your phrase is perfectly legit. :D
* [chat] Rowan: ...if sometimes deadly ;)
* [chat] Rowan: "guess the phrase" uses names of mobs, objects, locations, etc
in the game, so it does become easier as you get more experience in the
game.
* To complete the Darbyn's (first?) lapidary quest, polish a gem in front of
him.
* [Hint]: Place the materials for the level 75 whip in your crafting inventory
with the syntax 'craft inventory put all'. Then use the syntax 'craft <item
type> <level> random' to start crafting a level 75 whip with randomized stats.
Once you have begun, using the command 'craft state' will provide helpful tips
for each step in the process.
* 'craft help materials'.
* 'craft nails 1'.
* 'help artisans'.
* Undersea Shipwrecks can be found from HoneyBee Village. Look for Coral
Island (east from a bridge IIRC) and head down. 'look around' where needed
and then 'pull plant'.
* One can buy potions of underwater breathing from a vendor on Bamboo Bridge
in Hillock Hills.
* 'craft rod 1'.
* 'compass' can add points of interest.

Unsure whether 'stoke fire' is necessary for 'make gems'. (I think so.)
