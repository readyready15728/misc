# Stardew Valley Notes
## "It ain't much but it's honest work"

* Tools and other objects have very limited range.
* Check the weather forecast for rain which will mean you don't have to water
  your crops.
* Television also conveys other useful information, such as recipes.
* Little 3x3 grids for crops are optimal (at least in the beginning?).
* Don't plant more than 15 crops unless you have one or more scarecrows, each
  of which defends an 8x8 area. (This means scarecrows can be placed in the
  center of four 3x3 plots.)
* Fishing can be very frustrating. What's worked for me so far is casting the
  line out as far as possible with the Training Rod, which will presumably
  become useless at level 5 of Fishing.
* Only two advanced fishing rods can use bait.
* Stumps don't grow back so I'm not sure why some people appear to advocate
  leaving them there.
* A chest to store excess goods is the first item you should craft. In terms
  of degradation of materials it appears to make no difference whether chests
  are in- or outdoors.
* Fences are useful for keeping weeds at bay and protecting crops.
* Pierre's General Store has the upgraded backpacks for 2000G and 10000G
  respectively.
* Seasons are 28 days long. Plan sowing and reaping accordingly.
* Cauliflower is a good beginner's crop.
* "Always Show Tool Hit Location" appears useful.
* Use fertilizer.
* Use crab pots.
* It's necessary to go behind the counter to "meet" entrepreneurial villagers.
* Pierre's General Store has a calendar posted out front.
* Tilled ground without crops on it will gradually be reclaimed by nature.
* Put paths under sprinklers and scarecrows to prevent them from being hoed
  up.
* Plant strawberries in the spring. (Seeds available at the Egg Festival.)
* Trout Soup enhances Fishing skill for a while.
* Be sure to **identify** recipients of quest items positively before giving
  the item.
* Bring food with you into the mines.
* Right click to move just single items between chests/inventory.
