# RimWorld Notes

## Notes for the colony simulator RimWorld

* Zoom in when selecting a starting site for finer-grained control.
* Recommendation on starting colonists from r/RimWorld:

>Usually one person who is good at shooting (5-6 or higher), good at
>growing/cooking (5 or higher), and a researcher/social/crafter (6 or higher)
>are my minimums.
>It doesn't make it exact so all Colonists will be the same every time. It
>leaves a level of randomness while keeping what is necessary in. You'll
>survive fine without perfect Colonists.

Also:

>Cook who can grow, crafter who can med, constructor who is social. That's a
>good starting point imho. Nobody into drugs/pyro, all capable of violence and
>firefighting.

* Some initial supplies may be scattered away from the main crash site. (At
least in that story mode.)
* Double-click an item to select all visible items of that type.
* Q and E rotate the thing you want to build.
* Forbidding doors is a possibility.
* Refrigerated storerooms are the best sort of storage area.
* Multiple cooling and/or heating units may be needed for a given room.
* Caravans can be formed to explore the world.
* Selecting a colonist and right-click a workstation to direct them there. A
message will appear explaining why the task can't be carried out if that is
the case.
* Mine steel and other important minerals from formations on the map. Any
given formation will likely have more than one resource.
* Rescuing people requires an open bed.
* Tame animals need places to sleep.
* Tame animals can be trained.
* Plants can be harvested and animals hunted for an early source of food.
* For hunting to be useful, a stockpile must accept corpses and a butcher's
workstation needs to be given orders.
* Ensure an ample supply of wood for power generation etc.
* Animals will attack doors if a colonist is seen moving through them, as well
as inactive turrets.
* Use rice as the first food crop then switch to something that will be more
productive.
* Medical beds can't be used for colonists.
* Colonists won't pick up items if storage room doesn't exist.
* If a storage room is full, click twice to interface with it.
* Schedule, Assign etc. can be used for more advanced colonist management.
* Medical procedures can be scheduled by going into a colonist's Health then
using the Operations tab.
* Columns are needed to hold up the roofs of larger buildings.
* It's best to interact with traders using pawns with high Social. (Traders
have a blinking question mark above their heads.)
* Ctrl-Click also works for operations like harvesting.
* Allies bring more caravans.
* Dirt and raw meat look similar in your inventory. Be careful!
* Make sure you're not cooking fine meals or higher grade if ingredients
aren't diverse enough.
* Colonists will tend to optimize clothing automatically but the choices can
be altered in Assign.
* Appropriate food is needed to tame animals.
* Ways to avoid fire:
  * Breaking up buildings into separate ones
  * Using less flammable material
  * Firebreaks (e.g. concrete floor three or four strips wide)
* Wardens need to take care of prisoners.
* Hover mouse over shooting target after selecting shooter to see accuracy.
* Drugs can be burned if causing an issue.
* Ctrl and Shift can be used to increment or decrement the number of times an
order is to be carried out at a workstation 10 and 100 times respectively.
* Friendly fire never occurs when allies are close.
* Hunting animals with "boom" in their name can be dangerous.
* Once a shuttle is loaded for a quest, send it immediately.
* Ruins can be deconstructed for valuable resources.
* Animals have to be assigned trainers to be trained and this requires proper
food for the type of animal.
* A workstation needs to be not busy if it is to be deconstructed.
* Healers need to enable self-tend explicitly.
* Gold can be found in some rock deposits.
* Colonists can become jealous of others' accommodations.
* Food storage near cooking facilities in addition to letting cooked food drop
rather than be taken to the storage area can greatly improve the efficiency
of cooking.
* Chairs make workstations more efficient.
* Meditation time can be set in Schedule, and psyfocus for psykers can be set
individually.
* Psykers require meditation sites specific to their focus. See here:
