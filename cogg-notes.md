# Notes for the MUD COGG

* "After dying, a character's soul will have opportunities to ring the
Deathknell by looking at a bell in the death area. This will put out a signal
to others with Deathknell sensitivity training (said training can be acquired
at Twilight Eye services office, commonly found on the second floor of your
local Town Hall), which can be heard by anyone with an ESP artifact regardless
of ESP zone (even if not in a zone at all). This signal will alert others who
can hear the Deathknell that the character has died and will reveal the dead
character's aura, as well as give an estimate to others of their proximity to
the dead character's corpse. Additionally, the other characters will be able
to use the aura who command to see the aura and corpse proximity information
for anyone who has recently rang the Deathknell within the past few minutes in
order to help them home in on the corpse's location for a rescue."
* Resurrection appears possible without such intervention, though it comes
with a price. (See 'help dying'.)
* Bugs can be reported with 'bug'.
* 'tell' is used to send OOC messages.
* There's a BBS on the website.
* Use 'language' to select second language and switch languages.
* The Discord is pretty active for asking questions.
* Use 'check mail' for the same.
* Hold an item in right hand and use 'appraise' to see how much it will cost
 to mail it. Use 'mail' with item in same hand to send it.
* Use 'mail set' to set up mailbox.
* 'order' can be used to order parchment, packages or quills.
* 'riln' shows the amount of 'riln' on hand.
* 'rent room' at an inn front desk at least once to rent a room for a period
of one or more days a
* At a bank, 'store' can be used to store items for a nominal fee and
'retrieve' used to retrieve items for free.
* Rented rooms can be used to store items and rest.
* "If you log out in an inn room for a certain amount of time, you get a
morale bonus when you log back in. How much depends on how long you were
logged out. On the other hand, if you're like me and like to idle, being in an
inn or vault room the game won't kick you off".
* Use 'experience' to see the situation with gaining levels.
* 'skills' can be used to view skills.
* Pay attention to words in parentheses next to a room name.
* 'train' can be used (where appropriate) to train skills.
* Use 'browse' or 'list' at a shop to see what they have. 'order' purchases
items.
* 'abilities' shows the different ability commands.
* Train Cooking in the Hearth & Home Inn Party Room. Practice Cooking in the
Hearth & Home Inn Kitchen.
* When you use the skills command you'll notice that there is a column for
"practice". You can only train a skill so far before you need to get some
actual practice with that skill, so go out and actually put your skills to use
so you can practice them and then train them further. Do note that when
viewing the skill training available in a room, it may show a "max" amount,
meaning you can't train any higher than that amount in that training room. It
may be required to join a specific Guild or Society in order to train certain
skills to higher levels, such as the Warrior Guild for training up combat
skills particularly high.]
* 'task list' at a task hub will list available tasks.
* 'task checkin' at a task hub will result in payment upon completion.
* 'help prompt' gives some very useful info.
* Use 'change' in the bathhouse changing room.
* 'dry' can be used to dryself after using the bathhouse.
* "'Course, not all communication's in person. If you find yourself writing a
letter to someone, don't forget to sign it with your name and mailbox number
after you've written it. Otherwise, the recipient won't know where to send a
response. When it comes to posting on the town boards, remember there're two
main ones: One's in Town Commons for posting 'bout general town matters, but
keep advertising and seeking services to the other board at the marketplace.
Most people don't wanna have to sift through all the selling and hagglin' and
hawking and whatnot just to see if there's anything interesting posted 'bout
recent events. That's why we keep 'em separate."
* "Another interesting form of communication we got 'round here is in the form
of those crystal pendants - occult artifacts scavenged up from the ruins of
Aetgard. Put one on, and you get what people 'round here call ESP. With
that, you can transmit what you say out loud to the minds of others also
wearing the pendants over a real long distance. It's a pretty handy work of
occultism - no idea how the old Aetgardians figured it out, but usage of the
pendants is pretty instinctive for a lotta people. Just be aware that the
pendants can get weak after a while, and while you can still hear what other
people say, you won't be able to transmit your own words when one runs outta
juice. That's when you buy a new one at the market if there are any for sale,
or go scavenge one up yourself out in the ruins. And if all else fails, head
into Town Hall and up to the second floor where you can find the Twilight Eye
office - they got a big crystal in there that lets anyone standin' there use
ESP even without a pendant. Good for emergencies if you find yourself without
a pendant."
* "You mighta seen there's a big donation crate in the middle of Town Commons.
Stuff in there's free for anyone who needs it - mostly given by generous
folk for use by those recently showin' up in the Lost Lands, to help new
exiles get on their feet. Don't treat the thing as a trash barrel! And don't
take for free what you can afford to buy yourself: if you got money,
contribute to the economy by buyin' your own gear and leave the crate for
those who've fallen on hard times. Speaking of the economy, while
generosity's nice and admirable and all, don't start donating everything you
find or make: People gotta learn to provide and pay for themselves, and the
merchants and artisans are liable to get cranky if you're giving away for free
what they work hard to provide for an honest living."
* "Now, lots of exiles 'round here end up doing a bit of adventuring or
fortune-seeking. There's a whole lotta treasure out there in the ruins of
ol' Aetgard to be found, and lots of it's locked up tight in lockboxes. If
you need a locksmith, a good place to look is in the old warehouse on Market
Street. Locksmiths frequent that spot, waiting for customers to stop by and
bring 'em work. It's considered polite to tip your locksmith for their
services once they've finished, and if you happen to be a locksmith yourself,
know that it's also the custom 'round here to let customers choose their own
tip rate based on how they feel about your service. If you feel it's too low,
just let 'em know. Asking a set fee beforehand is considered rude 
- just the way things are."
* "If you find yourself out there exploring the wilderness, it might be best
for starters to simply **travel** the main roads. When you see a sign out
there, be sure to **read** it! Between the established roads and the signs
you come across on them, you should be able to figure out how to get between
most outposts easy enough. Just beware that some outposts have since fallen
to infestation, nether-corruption, or been overrun by some other type of nasty
creatures - it's always a good idea to **peer** into an area first and get a
glimpse of whether it looks safe or not. Oh, and of course: bring plenty of
travel food for the road. The distances out there are long, and there's not
always food to **forage** or **hunt**."
* "I shouldn't have to tell you: just be a decent person, and people'll treat
you decent. Don't take things that ain't yours, but don't think that there
aren't people around who don't have qualms with stealing. Never leave
something you value on the ground or out in public. Even if you don't see
anyone around or you're somewhere outta the way, there's always a possibility
someone'll chance by and snatch it up. If you want a safe place to store
valuables, head to the bank a block north and west of Town Commons where you
can **deposit** your money and **store** your belongings in your vault. And
on the subject of safe places, you might wanna **rent** a room at the inn,
where you can rest in safety on a comfortable bed, and you can leave your
items in your inn room safe and sound, too. If the rent's up and you still
have stuff in there, they'll just ship it to your local bank vault for you -
and charge you a fee, of course."
* "I'll be honest and say you're probably gonna end up getting hurt at some
point. This land ain't quarantined on account of it being so soft and safe,
after all. If you do find yourself needing medical attention, make your way
to the infirmary on Brewery Row, a block east and northeast from the Commons.
Keep in mind, though - lotta people packed into Shadgard, and only so much
healer's attention to go around. While there're usually triage workers 'round
the clock to take care of the more immediate life-threatening flesh wounds,
they often don't have time to get to the less immediate stuff like frostbite
or a cough or whatnot, with all the other patients waitin'. Might do you good
to make friends with a physicker - someone who can take care of other
conditions like infections, frostbite, and even give you some therapy if you
need it. Living in the Lost Lands can take a toll on one's mind, for sure."
* "On the note of getting hurt - you may have heard rumors about some folk
with a condition we call 'Undying'. I don't know too much about it, seein'
as I've put my sense to work at keepin' myself from gettin' killed, but the
idea there is that something 'bout these lands keeps some folk from staying
dead. Somehow or other, they pop back up somewhere eventually even after the
most gruesome and surest of deaths. Whether that kinda luck is good or bad's a
matter of debate 'round here. Some blame the nether, pulling souls back from
movin' on. Others attribute it to miracles of the Immortals - a mercy to
exiles thrust into an unforgiving land, or perhaps maybe a curse to keep 'em
from finding rest. Whatever the case - if you happen to be one so blessed or
cursed, and you wake up somehow after what shoulda been your last breath,
might be good to find your previous corpse when you can to recover your gear.
Most folks that find a corpse out somewhere will bring it back to the crypt in
the church on the south side of town, so that's a good place to look if you
think your corpse has been moved. And take it from me - seek a physicker for
some therapy if you end up wakin' alive up after dying. Yer gonna need it."

* 'travel' can be used on roads in the wilderness until coming to a fork in
the road.

short slim woman".
* Naming people after their pendant color is very efficient.

* "With very few exceptions you can get very detailed with targetting here,
with pretty much any command that matches to characters or objects. For
example if you're trying to buy a jar from the market, you can do things like
order unguent jar to get a jar that has unguent in it, or empty jar, or even
small empty jar. Another cool matching trick is using my and notmy. Example,
get notmy bag to grab a bag that isn't on your person, or l my shirt to look
at a shirt you have rather than one that's in the room. Just some tips that
have saved my sanity. lol"
* "The Rook Parlour trainers of Warlocks have left the Library of Qamar to
teach where they are more comfortable. Warlocks who had studied under the
trainers here can now seek them out in the mausoleum of Evergreen Cemetery in
Ravenwood (near Shadgard), or the Rook Parlour building in Mistral Lake, a
block west of the Shandy Gaff diner."
