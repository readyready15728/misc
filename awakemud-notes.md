# AwakeMUD Notes

* "You should also know that there will sometimes be 'doors' that have other
names, like 'vent' or 'panel', so you might find yourself needing to OPEN
VENT UP to access an air duct. These are usually apparent in the room
descriptions."
* "You can also KNOCK on closed doors to produce a message on the opposite
side of the door."
* 'score'.
* 'inv'.
* 'eq'.
* 'skills'.
* 'get modulator hopper'.
* 'train' / 'untrain'.
* 'help pools'.
* 'help defaulting'.
* 'practice' / 'unpractice'.
* 'skills'.
* "It's a good idea to pick up at least a little negotiation, as it improves
your autorun (quest) payouts! You'll also probably benefit from some
athletics, as even a few points can save you from nasty falls."
* "Beyond that, it's good to have at least one point in any driving skill so
you're able to handle vehicles. Everything else is flexible."
* Just 'help'.
* 'help newbie'.
* 'sheath' or 'holster' weapons when not in use.
* 'help tn'.
* Loss of Essence is permanent.
* 'list' / 'buy' / 'sell'.
* "When you stride out into the world, cyberware will be packaged up and given
to you instead of immediately being installed. You will have to find a
Player or NPC CYBERDOC to install it for you."
* [Khai]: What Aardwolf calls "tell catching" is similar to our history
commands. E.g., "history tells", "history ooc", "history radio".
* "Bioware aims to replace biological systems in your body with improved, man
made versions. This process is very complicated as it requires the new
organs to be matched closely to your body's existing biological makeup.
However, where excessive Cyberware leads people to being very emotionally
detached and psychotic, Bioware can cause intense physical problems. Lowered
resistance to diseases, longer healing periods and less resistance to deadly
damage. All characters can have a maximum of 9 Body Index points of Bioware.
But once it starts to exceed Essence Index (Essence + 3) the severe drawbacks
begin to kick in."
* 'cyberware' / 'bioware'.
* 'probe'.
* 'probe #2' (in shops).
* 'nuyen'.
* It's important not to carry cash on you at all times.
* "Characters can store their funds in bank accounts. At an ATM, type BALANCE
to see how much money is in the account, DEPOSIT to deposit your funds, or
WITHDRAW to make a transaction."
* "Credsticks, small pen shaped credit cards, are also a safe way to store
money. Credsticks can be personalized by someone to keep their funds safe,
but can also be rigged by someone who is proficient in ELECTRONICS. To
personalize a credstick, simply ACTIVATE it. If the credstick has already been
activated, you must CRACK the security with your ELECTRONICS skill before you
can access the nuyen within. You can use credsticks to make purchases
automatically with the funds from your account, although some illegal street
dealers will only accept rolls of nuyen."
* "The radios used by Shadowrunners in 2064 are specialized Matrix terminals
linked through the Shadowland network. This allows them heavy security from
most normal law enforcement agencies, but it is still possible to track
someone down through it."
* "Radios are an IN-CHARACTER form of communication: disregard the way you
behave and think about how your character would act."
* To operate a radio use the RADIO command. This will show you its current
settings. To center the radio at a frequency (the most common is 8mhz), type
RADIO CENTER \<frequency\>. To scan through all frequencies type RADIO SCAN.
Encryption rating can be set by typing RADIO CRYPT \<rating\>. Only radios with
an encryption rating greater than or equal to what you have it set at can
receive them."
* "To broadcast a message type BROADCAST \<message\>. Turning the radio off can
be accomplished with RADIO OFF."
* "Phones are a more private form of communication. When you acquire a phone
and wish to use it, you must first find the eight digit telephone numbers of
the people you want to call. Type PHONE to see your settings."
* "Type CALL (phone number) to start calling someone. If they answer, use TALK
(message) to start talking with them. Type HELP PHONE for more information
on settings and calls. Head NORTH to learn about doors and maglocks."
* "Doors can be locked and unlocked using the LOCK and UNLOCK commands,
directions or door names can be used as arguments. To 'pick' a lock you use
the BYPASS command. To do this you need an electronics kit however."
* "It is also possible to kick or shoot doors down, using the KICK or SHOOT
commands. Also, the KNOCK command can be used to alert someone on the other
side of a closed door."
* "There are a few entries on the score sheet that may not be obvious. Karma
is basically your experience in the world. You gain more by killing other
people and/or completing Shadowruns. Your total karma is divided into two
sections; Reputation, the karma gained through performing Shadowruns and
Immortal Awards; and Notoriety the karma gained through killing."
* "Essence is the amount of humanity you have left, or how well attached your
spirit is to your body. Cyberware will reduce Essence. As your essence drops
so does your magic rating. Lower essence and more cyberware decreases the
likelihood of beneficial magic affecting you. Essence and magic lost this way
cannot be restored. However, essence holes are left when cyberware is removed,
allowing replacement without further essence or magic loss."
* "There are two kinds of Armour in the world of Shadowrun; Ballistic and
Impact. Ballistic protects against bullets. Impact protects against slower
moving projectiles like arrows, fists, swords and explosions."
* "Once more than one piece of armour is being worn at once a process known as
layering takes place. The highest rating piece of armour is applied in full,
then half the value of all other pieces is applied. The full total of all
pieces is used to calculate penalties though."
* "If the unlayered value of your ballistic or impact armour values is greater
than your modified quickness you begin to experience penalties due to your
movement being restricted. You will move slower, lose combat pool, and have a
harder time using quickness based skills like athletics or ranged combat. Form
fitting armour is not included in the calculations for layering penalties
however."
* "Elevators are essential to traveling about the many, many buildings and
areas in Awake. When you are in front of an elevator, type LOOK PANEL to see
where the elevator currently is. To call the elevator, type PUSH BUTTON."
* "Try looking at the elevator panel again to see which floors this elevator
is connected to. Head to a specific floor by typing PUSH (floor number you
wish to go to)."
* "Decking is a fairly complex art, almost a whole game unto itself. To
connect to the matrix, find a room that mentions a dataport and CONNECT.
From there you have a variety of options: You can LOCATE another host, then
LOGON to it. You can attempt to LOCATE files and DOWNLOAD them."
* "But first you need a cyberdeck and four 'persona' programs - body, evasion,
sensors and masking. You must INSTALL these programs to access even the most
basic of hosts. Once you get started, you'll realise that a lot of operations
fail. To improve your chances of succeeding, you can add additional utilities
to your deck. Use the SOFTWARE command to get the values and names of software
you have installed."
* "See the help files: MATRIX, INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES, CYBERDECKS,
PROGRAMS, UTILITIES, LOCATE, LOGON, ANALYZE, DOWNLOAD, SOFTWARE and RUN for
more information."
* 'help astral'.
* "Surplus gear can be stowed in numerous locations. First off are storage
lockers, available in a few places around the MUD. They can hold a small
amount of gear and cost 50 nuyen a day for a maximum of 7 days. If you leave
it for more than 7 days the locker is automatically cleared."
* "Next is vehicles, how much a vehicle can hold varies greatly depending on
the vehicle. You can store gear in bikes as well, but a word of warning,
anyone can take it so it isn't a safe option."
* "Apartments are the best way to store gear. Not only can you store surplus
gear in them, but you can reload in them if you quit once while inside.
Also, no one but yourself and anyone you specify with the HOUSE command can
gain entrance. Apartments are also the most expensive."
* "If you happen to find yourself in an apartment that you do not own and are
locked in, use the LEAVE command to escape at any time."
* "You can purchase credits here to help pay for an apartment in 10,000 credit
lots using the RECHARGE command. These cards are non-transferable and can be
used towards any apartment in the MUD."
* 'help rigging'.
* "Driving is not too different from rigging. To enter a vehicle, first UNLOCK
the vehicle and ENTER it. To begin driving, type DRIVE. To adjust speed,
type SPEED (idle/cruise/speeding/max). To defend yourself from someone who's
attacking your vehicle, you can RAM him, which will result in damage to your
vehicle. If your vehicle is destroyed, all passengers and some of the stored
materials inside will be flung out into the street, where they will take heavy
crash damage in addition to being in the unenviable position of confronting
whatever destroyed their vehicle. In the world of 2064, the isolated
city-state of Seattle is surrounded by unfriendly nations, all of which firmly
patrol their borders and shoot intruders on sight. It is not recommended that
you attempt to drive past a border fortification."
* "The man in this room also can sell a vehicle to you if you have the money
for one. He won't give you the actual car itself, but he will give you a
TITLE that you cash in for a vehicle at the end of the area. Driving isn't
essential, however, as Seattle boasts an effective cab system: simply type
HAIL when you're out on the street to flag down a cab. There is a sign here
with basic details and information for the vehicles the dealer has for sale."
* "Useful help files: VEHICLES, DRIVER, UPGRADE, UNINSTALL, REPAIR, GRIDGUIDE,
VEMOTE, PAINT".
* 'wear' / 'wield'.
* 'probe' / 'info'.
* "Outside of character generation, you'll sometimes see items sold with a
difficulty listed. These represent things that are hard to get ahold of. If
you decide to purchase one of those items, you'll want to be familiar with the
CHECK and RECEIVE commands. All times of order arrivals are by gameplay TIME."
* "Here a decker or rigger can purchase the equipment they need to get their
job done. Glass cases store CYBERDECKS, PROGRAMS, and UTILITIES, all of
which are needed to successfully DECK the MATRIX. The core of a deck is the
MPCP, as well as knowledge, so reading through these helpfiles will greatly
advance ones ability to navigate the matrix. The SOFTWARE command will offer a
view of a cyberdecks contents, so keep that in mind. Rigger equipment is also
sold here, and various electronic devices are stored in storage lockers. A
rather large showcase display case is also set up here, which offers
information on the various cyberdecks being sold."
* <https://shadowrun.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowrun_Reference_Standard_Codes>
* 'status'.
* 'help vision'.
* 'info' is **REALLY** important. (Can be used in shops.)
* 'examine'.
* 'help gps'.
* "The ambulance service in the Seattle Metroplex is handled by DocWagon. It's
possible to purchase contracts with DocWagon for them to provide you with a
premium service. Depending on the complexity of getting access to your
location, and the level of your contract DocWagon can retreive you and all of
your gear when you are on the verge of death, negating all penalties for
mortal wounds. The higher the initial cost of the contract the more of a
chance they will get to you in time and the cheaper it will be for each
retreival."
* DocWagon modulators need to be bonded and worn to work!
* Re: a sport rifle: "WIELD it in combat for best results. You can also
HOLSTER it if you have the right equipment."
* Re: a box of rifle ammunition: "It's used with the POCKETS command-- see
HELP POCKETS for details."
* 'help reload'.
* 'hold'.
* Binoculars impose a huge penalty to spellcasting and combat when held and
are best used only for 'scan'.
* 'help holster'.
* 'attach silencer ruger'.
* "Here you can purchase from either armoured clothing, standard clothing or
standard armour. All armour is legal in the world of 2064, except for
military or security armour. Security armour needs a permit, but military
armour can never be used by civilians."
* "Most clothing comes with pockets, or attachments specially for holsters or
ammo clips. These are used as standard containers, but if you are wearing
the article of clothing then you can access what is inside as though it is in
your inventory."
* "Armoured clothing is sold in sets. Within these sets you may wear any
combination of pieces you want and the layering rules will not come into
effect. Infact you often get bonuses for wearing an entire set in the area of
or 2 extra points of armour. This is not to say you can't wear one piece of
armoured clothing with another set, you just won't receive the bonuses."
* "This section of the Neophyte Guild will teach basic combat. Characters with
high INITIATIVE tend to get more actions than their opponents. To initiate
combat, type KILL (target). Once combat is engaged, you will have a limited
number of actions you can perform in each combat round and movement does
consume an action. Once you run out of actions you may find yourself waiting a
moment for the game to tick over to the next combat round."
* "Killing should only be initiated on MOBs (mobiles, computer controlled
non-player characters). All of your kills will gain you karma and increase
your NOTORIETY."
* "Don't even think about trying to start a fight with another player unless
you both have toggled your player-killer flags - you won't do any damage at
all, whereas your opponent will be able to hurt you. Continue SOUTH to learn
more about combat."
* "This section will teach you about basic, same-room combat. When both
opponents are in the same room, you can initiate a fight with the KILL
command. If both characters are using melee weapons, they'll just duke it out.
Likewise, if both characters are using firearms, they'll take turns shooting
at each other."
* "However, if one character is using a melee weapon and their opponent has a
firearm, the melee wielder will need to "close the distance" using their
QUICKNESS against the target's REACTION before they can try to attack their
opponent. It is difficult to attack someone with a sword if they happen to be
spraying you with full automatic fire. When a character wielding a gun in
melee is attacked, they use the the butt of their gun as a CLUB."
* "Attributes like QUICKNESS and BODY are very important for combat.
INTELLIGENCE and WILLPOWER supplement your COMBAT POOL, which is also
helpful. STRENGTH is useful for increasing the power of your attacks if you're
using a melee weapon."
* "Combat can also be initiated in other ways: Casting a combat spell on
someone will start a fight, and casting spells in the middle of combat
requires intense concentration- the harder the spell, the longer it will take
to cast it."
* "Keep in mind, Mana based spells do not affect inanimate objects such as
training dummies. They are, however, affected by physical based spells."
* "There are various options that can affect how a firearm works. The main is
the type of ammo you currently have loaded, while only normal ammo is
available here in Chargen there are 5 other types available in the outside
world. You can find out more about these in HELP AMMO."
* "The firing mode can also be changed on most weapons. Type MODE with your
weapon wielded to see available fire modes and then MODE <SS/SA/BF/FA> to
change it to the desired mode. The more rounds you fire at once the more
damage and power your attacks have. Firing extra rounds also makes your
attacks harder to dodge, but at the cost of also making it harder to hit due
to recoil. "
* "Recoil compensating attachments can help negate this however. A word of
warning, while very powerful, burst fire shotguns and other heavy weapons
suffer double the penalty from any recoil not negated by attachments."
* "Tested your basic combat abilities on those training robots? Now it's time
to learn about ranged attacks. If you're using a ranged weapon like a
firearm, you can attack people from other rooms. Type SCAN now to see WEST
into the Shooting Range. You can hit people in other rooms with the SHOOT
command. To fire at someone, type SHOOT (target) (direction). Naturally, it is
more difficult to shoot someone from far away than it is if they're in the
same room: gun accessories like smartlinks, laser sights, gas vents, and
scopes can make the task easier. Silencers and suppressors (See: Help
Silencer) help keep your shooting activities attract less attention. Practice
ranged combat here if you want, and head SOUTH to learn more about combat."
* "Combat can be a difficult task. Thankfully, this section teaches you some
commands that can make survival easier. If you've gone in over your head and
started a fight with someone that you're losing, you can FLEE to try to run
away. Fleeing will attempt to move your character out of the room through a
random exit- you may escape the fight, or you may run into more opposition if
you're not careful. For a more precise, but more difficult method of escaping
combat, try to retreat. You can run away from a specific direction if you try
to move in that direction. The WIMPY command can be used to set your character
to automatically flee once they're wounded enough."
* "What if you don't want to run away from a fight? To avoid getting hit, you
have a COMBAT POOL. Your COMBAT POOL is determined by your QUICKNESS,
INTELLIGENCE, and WILLPOWER attributes. In combat, your COMBAT POOL will add
dice to either your dodge test, damage resistance test, or offensive dice
rolls. To set your combat pool use the CPOOL command."
* "Wounds: The weapons in Shadowrun all have a set, realistic DAMAGE rating:
Light, Moderate, Serious, and Deadly. Based on the skill of your weapon
handling, you can increase the amount of damage you deal to an opponent."
* "Injuries can inflict penalties upon your character (and enemy mobs) due to
the pain they cause. Other things can cause penalties too - such as it being
too dark, mist, smoke, or your opponent being invisible. Knowing what TIME it
is and taking a moment to SURVEY the room can help."
* "Real-life injuries can be just as debilitating, and can be avoided through
clever use of the ! command to reduce repetitive stress."
* Momo |]newbie[| Gameplay time relates to picking up items from shops, the
time of day echoes, etc
* Momo |]newbie[| Roleplay time is the time in seattle for the purposes of
"good morning", what time a scene at a bar is set, etc
* "The main purpose of this MUD is to have fun. Use SAY and EMOTE to RP if you
want, constructing elaborate cyberpunk stories, or go around and kill
everything if you wish. Only time this doesn't apply is if you are
deliberately spoiling someone's fun."
* "It is recommended you create a custom description to benefit more fully
from the MUD. It is difficult to interact with others when you have no
description set at all to describe what your character looks like. To set your
descriptions, type CUSTOMIZE. Mages will have to make two descriptions: one
for their physical body and one for their Astral reflection. The same goes for
Deckers. For more detail, type HELP CUSTOMIZE and HELP DESCRIPTION."
* "Prompts have been made completely customizable, and can show any number of
things, see HELP PROMPT to utilize the PROMPT command."
* "Many individuals utilize nicknames, street names or runner aliases in the
shadows for all manner of reasons. The REMEMBER command will assist in
putting a name to a face or voice you're familiar with while interacting, as
well as allow you to craft your own namesake to offer others in turn."
* Iserna |]newbie[| Sort of. Gameplay time determines if, for purposes of vis
modifiers, the Sun is up or not. But if you're, like, standing inside in a
bright room it doesn't directly matter.
* Coil |]newbie[| Most mechanical things run off gameplay time, with the
exception of some things that are particularly punishing when they only last
like 1 minute IRL, but should be much longer. Renting an apartment/lifestyle
is also measured in IRL months.
* 'use pocket secretary'.
* 'help johnson'.
* 'help open'.
* 'health'.
* Coil |]newbie[| If you probe weapons you'll see damage codes like 9M, that
means they do M damage normally but can be staged up with extra successes on
the attack roll. The number is the target number to soak the damage with Body
and Cpool dice, though armor reduces the TN. Every 2 successes to soak reduces
the damage by one stage (moderate to light, for example).
* \A well accentuated melodic baritone/\[8 MHz, English\](CRYPTO-1): What kind
of storage? portable storage space like bags? there is a phoenix bag sold in

* 'Wared Adept Troll with polearm might be what I want for a rescue character.
(Or do I really want a Mage?)
* Initially an Adept will only want to spend about 1 Essence then spend more
later on.
* "At least when it comes to a troll with a polearm, it's a very low cost of
entry because they can handle a lot already. Best bet would probably be to
invest in some early bioware (Toner and Aug, Trauma Damper, Cerebral Booster,
maybe Enhanced Articulation). Maxed attributes, a decent polearm, and as much
armor as you can comfortably wear will deal with most problems that don't
involve APDS or stunbolts."
