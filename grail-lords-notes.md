# Grail Lords Notes

- The game has a [Fandom wiki](https://the-grail-lords.fandom.com/wiki/The_Grail_Lords_Wikia).
- There is a [forum](https://thegraillords.forumotion.net/) as well. (Any
  Discord? Yes, look at the top of the tavern chat for the invite.)
- Apparently the Discord is kinda dead but there is also a
  [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGrailLords/). I was advised to use the
  tavern chat or Reddit as these are the most active.
- Increases in skill level make their use more stamina-efficient.
- "Towns like Camaar are safe places where you can interact with other
  Seekers. Visit the Marketplace to purchase all kind of food, goods or items.
  Find a job at the Labor Hall or join a Guild at the Workshops. In time you
  even can start a criminal career. At the Town Announcements you can find the
  latest information about your town, hints and special requests."
- "One of the strong points of this Realm is the Grail Community. There is an
  active and devoted group of players who gladly help new Seekers. They provide
  you with free bread at the Soup Kitchen, guides on the Grail Forum and will
  happily answer any question you might have. Bring a visit to the Grail Tavern
  and chat with other the Seekers."
- "Once a day there is a Daily Reset in which you will receive a stamina
  refill. You will notice that whenever you use stamina, some of your Skills
  will increase. The higher your skills become the more efficient your
  performance will be."
- Contact Sakura if I am in need.
- The soup kitchen in town gives free bread for the first 30 days.
- Look in the Camaar Town Office notes and, of course, the help page for help.
- "I also recommend contacting Nox Vigilo once you hit 14 days of age to be
  added to the soup programme."
- "Also, I recommend you get a Grail journal to improve your learning skills
  by writing in it daily, which will increase your daily available stamina."
- "Finally, for the money part, I recommend you to join a guild, and once you
  have done that, also apply as an apprentice to one of the guild masters who
  has open slots. That will allow you to slowly but surely create better items
  the more your skill of a given guild increases, which you can sell in the
  market for money or fulfil requests and get money like that, too."
- "Additionally I highly recommend to check out the current town programms in
  the announcement of the town hall."
- "Generally it is a good idea to concentrate on a few skills first and
  gradually expand your fields of expertise."
- "Eating daily is an important aspect of the life here in the Realm! If you
  don't eat regular, you'll become starved. Starving Seekers receive less
  Stamina, recover slower from wounds and eventually start losing
  Life-points."
- \[After mentioning the soup kitchen again\] "You can also go to your Kitchen
  and create your own Cooked Meals, using various food ingredients such as meat,
  vegetables, eggs or fish. These food ingredients can be either bought at the
  Marketplace or you can gather them yourself."
- "The big advantage from eating cooked meals is that they raise some of your
  Personal Skills based on the food ingredients used in addition to removing
  your hunger."
- Meals you cook in the kitchen of your residence will be available at the
  dinner table in the same place.
- Make sure that relevant tools are equipped before going anywhere.
- Tools eventually break, but high quality tools last longer.
- "At the Item Market you can sell and buy items, tools and potions from other
  Seekers. It is good practice to inspect a tool before purchasing it as some
  Seekers might try and sell heavily used tools with only little durability
  left."
- The currency system of gold, silver and bronze coins is decimal in nature.
- "Once you pass through the Town Gate, you will no longer be inside the
  safety of the town. Outside, you will be able to venture through forests,
  plains, cross rivers and climb mountains. You’ll be able to go fish, chop
  wood, cut stone or visit the mines where you can make a fortune mining for
  ore. When you follow the roads you will discover new places and be able to
  visit the other towns of the Realm."
- "If you are looking to make some money, you can always visit the Labor Hall
  in town. There you can find jobs paid by other Seekers or you can work
  directly for The Grail Lords and earn a small wage."
- Stamina needs to be allocated to crafting manually in some cases.
- Like tools, weapons and armor need to be equipped before becoming useful.
- It is possible to hire followers for a time for various bonuses.
- Animals can die from starvation or from old age.
- Animals need to be fed daily.
- "Seekers need to be in their hometown to feed and handle animals."
- "A Butcher Knife must be equipped to slaughter any animal."
- Chickens are good starter livestock.
- "Milk can be drunk to increase the Physical Resistance Skill."
- "Milk also can be used to prepare Cheese (expensive food)."
- The following livestock are considered to be for more advanced Seekers:
  - "\[Pigs give\] +2 on the Luck Skill for each pig alive."
  - Pigs can be fattened with corn. Meat yield of pigs is dependent on
    fattening.
  - "\[Sheep can\] be sheared once in 3 days which provides 5 Wool."
  - "\[The horse\] requires a lot of money and is meant for experienced
    Seekers.
  - "Can be be trained once a day into a Warhorse (takes 100 days)."
  - "Once completely trained the Horse can be upgraded to a follower."
  - "No maximum age and can only die from starvation."
  - "Additional ranch slots can be constructed to hold up to 9 animals at the
    same time. Expanding the ranch requires Wood, Iron Nails and Stamina. The
    costs increase with each ranch pen already constructed. They also can be
    demolished and a part of the previously Wood and Iron Nails will be
    salvaged."
  - "All animals are produced by the town’s breeding program. Seekers can
    improve their Animal Attitude Skills by helping the town with their Breeding
    Program in the Labor Hall in exchange for a wage."
