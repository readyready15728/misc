If the player is flagged as away or is in combat, you may see a message that
your tell will be saved until they can read it. To send a tell to the last
person who sent you a tell, use 'reply [message]'."
* Aaeron says, "If someone sends you a tell while you are away, or you have
'catchtells' on, type 'replay' to see it. Your tell history can be seen by
typing 'tell -h'."
* 'friend'.
* 'ftalk'.
* 'info'.
* 'quiet'.
* 'help forums'; 'help note'.

* Aaeron says, "To read a forum, type 'forum [forum name]' to switch to that
forum, then 'note read' to read each note in order. Using 'note list 50'
will show the headers of only the last 50 notes."
* Aaeron says, "If you find a forum you are not interested in, you can stop
seeing announcements for it by typing 'subscribe [forum name]'. Repeat the
same command to turn it back on. Type 'subscribe' on its own to see all forums
and their status."
* Aaeron says, "To learn how to write notes of your own, or search the list
of posted notes by author, by recipient or by title; please study 'help
note'."
* Aaeron says, "There are two forums that are important for you to read each
time you login. The 'announce' and 'mudinfo' forums contain important
updates from the game administration and often list newly added commands and
features."
* Aaeron says, "Finally, as a new player, the amount of notes already on the
forums can be overwhelming. You can skip over all notes on a single forum
using 'note catchup'. To skip all notes on all forums except announce and
mudinfo, use 'note catchup all'."
* 'bigmap'.
* 'help world'.
* 'help map'.
* 'explored'.
* 'areas explored' / 'areas unexplored'.
* 'rank 15' for top explorers.
* Klau says, "Some area quests can be quite complex, but the clues are
there. Be careful to read descriptions carefully and 'listen' to
characters in areas for clues if you plan to complete area quests."
* Klau says, "Portals are commonly used throughout the game and allow you to
quickly get from one place to another. Portals in the room are entered by
using 'enter [portal name]'. To use portals in your inventory, hold the portal
and type 'enter'."
* Klau says, "Some spells such as 'nexus' and 'chaos portal' create portals.
Other abilities such as 'wayfind' allow you to see the destination of a
portal before entering."
* Klau says, "Some monsters in the game drop portals when killed. Most portals
are acquired as a reward for completing area quests. Having completed the
quest, the portal allows you to quickly return to the area."
* Klau says, "Custom portals can also be purchased with trivia points, see
'help trivia portals' for more on this."
* Klau says, "Some rooms prevent the use of the 'recall' command but still
allow portal entry. It is recommended to keep at least one portal in your
inventory at all times for this reason. You can also enter portals while
webbed, see 'help web' for details on this spell."
* Klau says, "In addition to portals, many spells and skills allow you to move
around Andolor more freely. Check out 'spells movement' and 'skills
movement' to see examples. Each ability listed has its own helpfile."
* 'weather'.
* Klau says, "A number of skills and spells in the game are affected by the
weather. The ranger spell 'call lightning' is a good example; it is very
powerful but can only be used during a storm."
* Klau says, "Magic in Andolor is highly influenced by the moons. There are 3
moons and their simple names are the white moon, grey moon and black moon."
* Klau says, "Magic is slightly more effective when the moon corresponding to
your alignment is in the sky, and much more effective when all 3 moons are
in the sky. Players focused on enchanting equipment watch the moons very
carefully."
* Klau says, "Andolor has many seasons and its own time system. Knowing the
game time can often be important. For example, the creatures in the
graveyard only come out after dark and parts of other areas are only open
during certain times of the day. What time is considered 'dark' varies by the
season."
* Klau says, "To see the time and season, use the 'time' command. Each 30
seconds of offline time (or each tick) is 1 hour in Andolor. Each season has
a slight influence on the game that you will learn as you explore."
* 'open'.
* 'unlock'.
* Klau says, "If a key is on the ground before a locked door, 'unlock'
automatically uses that key. Many adventurers will leave keys for others to
use, please leave them there."
* Klau says, "Thieves have a skill called 'pick lock' that attempts to open
a lock without the key. Warriors can go for a more direct approach and use
'bashdoor'. Mages have a spell called 'knock' that can sometimes open a
locked door."
* Klau says, "The 'passdoor' affect allows characters to walk through some
closed doors. The shadow race has pass door permanently. Pass door is also
available in a number of potions and can be purchased with quest points as
a 'wish'."
* 'exits'.
* Klau says, "Typing 'exits' in any room shows the list of visible exits.  You
also see a summary of exits in the room each time you look. To turn this on
and off, use the 'autoexit' command. If the exits list shows ( ) around an
exit name, that means the exit is closed."
* Klau says, "Some rooms show an exit as '[other]'. This means the exit is a
custom exit and not a standard direction. In this case, type 'exits' to see
the command needed to use that exit."
* Klau says, "Doors and custom exits are not always visible. Sometimes you
must explore and solve puzzles to determine the exits to use. For example,
examining a shelf may show that there is a hidden passage and the command to
enter is 'move shelf'. Other times, you just need to look around."
* 'clist'.
* Glimmer says, "Clans are an extremely important part of the Aardwolf
community. Clans worship their own deity, have their own halls built by
their members, their own morgues, recall rooms and private portals. Clans also
have private and public shopkeepers selling their own equipment, and skills
unique to each clan."
* Glimmer says, "To see rank names, leaders and other information for a clan,
use 'claninfo [clan name]'. To see a description of each clan's theme, type
'help [clan name]'."
* Glimmer says, "Most clans also list an external web site where you can
learn more about that clan. Clan web sites can be great resources for
further information on Aardwolf and often contain detailed maps, hints to
area quests and other information."
* Glimmer says, "'Boot Camp' is a clan focused on new players and helping
others learn the game. It is often recommended as a starting clan."
* 'help builders'.
* 'help testers'.
* 'help www'.
* Wolfie says, "There is no single best approach, but right after graduation I
recommend that you spend some time getting familiar with your guild
abilities, explore some of the lower level areas and start to quest."
* Wolfie says, "When you reach level 200, you can 'superhero' and continue
gaining levels to add stats, or can choose to 'remort' and add another
guild. At this point in your career, you will want to remort and add new
guilds (classes); staying at level 201 may be wasted effort later on."
* Wolfie says, "When you have all 7 guilds and reach level 201 again, you have
the option to 'retier' which basically means starting over, but with a
number of benefits that make it very worthwhile. Read 'help tier' for more
information on this. There are 10 tiers in total."
* 'help quests'.
* Wolfie says, "In addition to quests, you can choose to try a 'campaign' each
level. Campaigns are similar to quests but involve multiple targets, are
harder, and generally have higher rewards."
* Wolfie says, "See 'help campaigns' for more information on campaigns.
Commander Barcett in Aylor assigns campaigns to adventurers. Use 'find
campaign' from anywhere in Aylor to locate him."
* 'myrank'.
* 'finger'.
* 'afk'.
* 'visto'.
* The Academy Courtyard Fountain quells both thirst **and** hunger.
* If it's really dark and you're fumbling around, get a light source.
* Maerchyng says, "Andolor has many more mysteries for you to uncover. Visit
Kimr at his Farm to uncover a new goal, or try boarding the train in Lands
of Legend. There is also a goal in the Art of Melody for you to discover.
When you reach level 15, visit the Call of Heroes and listen to Mystlin. I
wish you good fortune in your travels Khayyam."
* 'value'.
* 'identify' only works on items in inventory, not equipment.
* 'Saraid: honestly I would turn off autoloot for now'.
* Turn 'autoloot' back on temporarily if you need an item.
* Open clan shops will buy items you find.
* Maybe turn on autoloot level 80?
* Or maybe not: "Teleron: Never becausse bonus loot items are what you need,
plus eqsearch can point to what you need."
* The Vlad area has all cursed items.
* "If you want a hard-copy of this guide, you can find it in Aylor's Library.
From anywhere in Aylor, type 'find library' or 'find all' for a list of all
the primary shops. However, note that you can always locate these help files
by typing 'index newguide'."
* "Teleron: If you can't sell them then just sacrifice them."
* Campaign mobs aren't marked explicitly like in quests.
* 'coordinates' in Vidblain.
* Use spaces to separate multiple recipients when sending a note.
* 'keep all.kibble'.
* 'get apple from tree'.
* 'open down'.
* Madrox (General) tells the CLAN: 'Please keep your ]An Old Duffle Bag[ safe
and sound. Also remember to lock any doors behind you that you may open with
it.'
* Madrox (General) tells the CLAN: 'For a layout of the clan hall type RLOOK
MAP at clan recall, or if you are visually impaired type RLOOK VIMAP at clan
recall.'
* Madrox (General) tells the CLAN: 'If you have any questions, please do not
hesitate to ask on clan channel via the command CLAN HI I'M NEW!'
* Szzilleriel (General) tells the CLAN: 'if you're having problems with runto
type 'runprefix down''
* The Boot Camp duffel bag can be used as a portal.
* 'spellup' is very useful.
* 'keyloot'.
* The Aard Amulet and Trivia Portals will be useful later.
* Once you max stats, instinct, HP, mana and moves are next.
* "Epsilon: Incidentally, do quests and campaigns. You'll need 500qp per mort
dead minimum (except your first, first SH advancement is free,) and then
you'll want to be able to spend on Aard items (help newbie-aard). And then
wishes after that (help wishes), then mastery/potential as you move towards
the endgame."
* 'help pclass'.
* 'help bonusloot'.
* 'daily blessing'.
* 'help tags'.
* 'consider all' can show the name of a mob whose name is unclear.
