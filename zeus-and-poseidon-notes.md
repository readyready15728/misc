# *Zeus* and *Poseidon* Notes
## Notes for the classic city builder game *Zeus: Master of Olympus* and its expansion *Poseidon* 

* Most construction activities can be done while paused.
* I tend to use a six-by-six grid for common housing and its support as well
as industry and eight-by-eight for elite housing.
* Adequate storage and access to storage can be a problem. Experiment with the
options to accept, not accept, get or empty. If a storehouse is too far away
for a certain building, consider either building a new storehouse nearer that
building, emptying out the old one and then demolishing it or building a
second, nearer storehouse and getting from the other one.
* Don't put olive groves and grapevines near to the other; in my experience
that resulted in the olives getting almost totally ignored which could have
been a much greater disaster than wine not getting delivered to the upper
class.
* The amount of food you produce doesn't matter if you don't have granary
capacity for it. Pay attention to food stocks as well as time of year and
harvest times then build accordingly.
* Consider building what might seem like an excess of agoras and cultural
venues if housing quality is in flux, affecting labor supply.
* Speaking of agoras, the vendors for elite housing have unusually short
reach; you will have to build more agoras for these houses than would be
expected for common housing.
* Achievement monuments are a great way to increase appeal over a substantial
distance.
* Consider strengthening relationships with allies early.
* If a monster just won't stop killing transporters of goods, reroute them
out of range of the monster.
* People don't like living near colleges for some reason (though podiums are
unaffected) so plan accordingly.
* Sanctuaries do not require maintenance.
* Elite housing does not require access to infirmaries or fountains.
* If agoras don't seem to be delivering goods effectively, it could be because
they are too distant from granaries and storehouses.
* Flickering in interface elements when using Wine can be remedied by
disabling something called CSMT. See the [relevant ArchWiki
article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wine) for details. (Doesn't apply
only to Arch.)
* Right-clicking rubble will show what that building once was.
* The "X" in the lower right corner of the Storehouse and Granary management
windows sets all goods to "Don't Accept".
* "See Industry" and other such displays can be used to see behind tall
buildings.
* Orange growing in Poseidon should be done a very short distance from a
granary.
* Raising wages increases the workforce.
