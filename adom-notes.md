# ADOM Notes

- Remember to use tactics settings.
- "If you feel the need to drink potions, zap wands or whatever while
  traveling through the wilderness and ADOM won't let you, enter a wilderness
  area first."
- Gods can help you when in a bind, so please them with sacrifices.
- The star sign Book might be good for Paladins and other "semi-casters".
- Candle, Raven and Tree are considered good star signs for pretty much
  anyone.
- Dump the "nearly useless" attributes of Appearance and Charisma during
  character generation and avoid excessive investment in somewhat less
  important attributes like Willpower, Perception and Learning (for
  non-casters).
- There's a [guide to attribute point distribution on the
  wiki](https://ancardia.fandom.com/wiki/Attribute_point_distribution_strategy).
- There's an overall [early game strategy
  guide](https://ancardia.fandom.com/wiki/Early-game_survival) as well.
- There's an [early game
  walkthrough](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADOM/comments/15n76ra/is_there_any_short_walkthrough_guide/)
  on Reddit.
- The Goblin Camp can (and must) be generated early in the game and freely
  visited later.
- Make note of the first life you take in the game and make sure it's a common
  mob in order to make the Courage quest (and possibly a few other things)
  easier.
- For Dwarves, acquiring Mithril Skin requires the following:
  1. Hardy: +3 hit points (To 10)
  2. Tough Skin: +1 to PV (Hardy, To 12)
  3. Iron Skin: +1 to PV (Tough Skin, To 15)
  4. Immune to Pain (Iron Skin, Will 15)
  5. Steel Skin: +2 to PV (Iron Skin, To 20)
  6. Mithril Skin: +3 to PV (Steel Skin, Dwarf)
- Desired total stats for Dwarven Paladin in character generation: 16, 15, 13,
  14, 15, 6, 3, 12, 12.
- Karmic creatures should not be attacked in melee. Note that **them**
  attacking **you** will not affect your like.
